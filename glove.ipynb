      "In the internship I just finished, I had to write rejection letters, editorial letters, and reader's reports. These documents require you to be very direct with writers, sharing the status of their submitted manuscript and, often, what changes you would like to see them make. My difficulty was that I struggled to be direct with the writers, even if they were hypothetical. I didn't want to be cruel or judgmental. So I met with the internship director, who challenged me to try to learn into judgment even though it was uncomfortable. What I found in following his instructions was that even when I felt like I was being mean, I was just producing a much more direct and helpful document than usual. So even though I'm still working on this, ultimately I learned how that direct communication is kind communication.\n",

      "Congratulations on your expecting bundle of joy. One of the greatest joys of being a parent is your ability to help your child blossom and grow. Some of the people who I consider great parents foster their children's interests. They go out of their way to find things that will facilitate to their own child's specific needs or interests. That is not to say the greatest joy is to spoil them, but watching your child's face light up at a new experience. That is a joy which can not be replaced. You get to have that joy with your child in numerous ways as they grow. I wish you the very best and remind you that you will make mistakes. As long as you help your child in all the ways you are able, you will be a great parent. \n",

      "One difficult challenge I faced in the workplace was the time my boss at the restaurant I was working for at the time was very overbearing. She would always be lording over me telling me what to do and how to do it even though I had been working there for almost a month and knew how to do the simple things she would tell me to do. She would also tell me I was slow doing tasks that had not been taught to me at all by anyone who could communicate it to me in a decent manner. I repaid all her efforts by quitting on the spot in the middle of my shift so they had no prep work done and no dishwasher.\n",

She is affectionate, engages and plays with babies and children, and is very caring. She anticipates and fulfills their needs, whether it be hungry, tired, or needing comfort, and makes sure they know that they are loved. She communicates well and actively listens.\n",

They will sacrifice their own needs in order to make sure their child lives a fulfilling live, whether it's to give the child good food to eat and/or working extra hours at work to pay for their child's tuition. The parent will allow the child to be who they want to be, but also lead them in a positive direction to make healthy decisions with their lives.\n",

      "A difficult challenge that I have experienced in the workplace is one concerning a difference of views on how to approach the objective task. Working in a small team with no defined leadership present (over-watching) has lead to the lack of a common unified point of view to cause some strain and unnecessary delays in the process.\n",
      "The traits that make a good parent are patience and understanding. Parents need to understand how their own trauma can affect their children. Parents need to understand their children are their own person and not just a mini-version of themselves. They will have a different love language, they will different ways they need to deal with stress and different interests. Parents also need to have good coping skills that they can teach their children so the kids don't end up having to self-soothe then become addicts later in life.\n",
      "My previous job was a bit challenging because the weather significantly affected the attitudes of customers. It's hard for someone to not complain when they're already upset. I would often try to pivot the conversation by asking how they're doing, if they're visiting the area, and try to offer suggestions to interesting places to make their time on the island more enjoyable.\n",
      "A difficult challenge that I can recall from my past is my attempt at implementing a system for a game that relies on status effects.  The primary difficulty that I've found with the system is that there are different types or roles of a status effect.  Such as: Poison and burns can be considered as effects that inflicts damage over time. Whereas: auras doesn't inflict damage but instead applies passive effects.  The main difficulty that I've faces was how to implement a system that can handle the flexibility of different types of effects.\n",

      "I had my first job as a senior. I was a shy kid and put in a new environment and assigned a new task, I was deeply afraid to ask questions. I did my tasks as a customer service representative hesitantly, which only created more anxiety. Eventually, I gathered up the courage to ask my supervisor for help. I found out that she was nicer than she came off as, and I become less afraid to ask questions, even ones that I considered stupid. It made me better at my job\n",
      "I would say patience is what makes a good parent. As a parent, your kids are your kids their whole life, and so if they don't have anyone else to reach out to, you might be the only one they can count on. I think about how patient my mother has been through all 30 years of my life and know I wouldn't be where I am without her patience.\n",
      "We were trying to get a generator/welder working at my job. We went through the entire trouble shooting list and still nothing. We have replace a lot of the parts and we still cannot fix the thing. It is currently sitting at our shop waiting to be fixed.\n",
      "When I first came to my current company things were a mess. They were not successful but also stuck in their ways. Being the new guy who was trying to change things was hard. They didn't like or trust me at all. It took a lot of patience and time to make changes that needed to happen. In the end, I think they realized I was here to change and wanted everyone to be successful. They started to trust me more and we got more things done eventually.\n",
      "I was working and serving food at the restaurant that I work at and when it was really busy I had to use the restroom and when I got back I got triple sat. I told the manager and the manager helped me get all the table's drink orders in a fast timely manner.\n",
      "One major factor in my life and personality is the fact that I have a difficult relationship with my family. I only realized a few years ago that it would be fair to characterize my mother's behavior as abusive and my father's behavior as neglectful. I try not to sit in a victim mentality about the situation, but it has been a big determinant for my current circumstances and the way I relate to most things in life. I'm constantly questioning the norms and traditions that most people take for granted and always looking for the truth beneath the surface because I spent so much of my life pretending everything was okay when it really wasn't.\n",
      "I worked in a daycare and this was my first time working ever with kids in a formal setting. I was 17 or 18 and just young. I remember the kids would always find a way to injure themsleves and i would have to watch like a hawk to make sure they did not get into any trouble. There was this one kid that almost got a concussion from playing on a swinging toy. Everything was my fault since I was responsbile for watching the kids.\n",
      "I think my mom is a very good parent. I say that because she always tries to find ways to help me out in every way form she can. She always tries to understand me even though I know no one truly will. That is why I think she is the best parent out there.\n",
      "I think that my mom is a great parent. She has shown this to me by being so forgiving. As a child, young adult and older I have done thing intentionally and unintentionally to her or just things that could have disappointed her and that has NEVER stopped her from showing me love.\n",

She is stern and shows authority, but is still loving and has a good relationship with them. She speaks in her native language and English so the kids are bilingual. She knows a lot about race and gender issues so she can speak comfortably with her kids. She listens to them and takes their concerns seriously. she doesn't spoil them, but does treat them to nice things on special occasions.\n",
      "No great examples came to mind. My mother is a good parent in the sense that she sacrificed a lot to ensure that we were ok, but she lacked a lot. However, when I think of a good parent, I imagine someone that is patient, apologizes to their children when they are wrong, take the time to teach them why certain actions are wrong. Be there for them in the best way possible and knowing when to stand back and let them learn from the consequences of their actions when necessary.\n",
      "I think what makes a good parent is someone who is patient, kind, loving, and understanding. Parents should also have healthy communication skills between them and their children in order to build trust and honesty. Parents should be willing to listen to their children's needs and not act uninterested.\n",
      "I had to work on a group project with a difficult coworker. They don't communicate well and run off doing their own thing without discussing it beforehand. I tried to come up with a game plan ahead of time and bringing it up with them so we could be on the same page. It started out well but further into the project they got lost on a tangent and didn't see the big picture anymore. After a follow up meeting I noticed they weren't working towards the main goal anymore and had to bring them back to the original goal and things progressed smoothly from there.\n",
      "it was difficult when my patient suddenly pass out. I was scared and almost passed out as well but i had to click the emergency button. The intensive care team and respiratory team came to my patients room. I explained to multiple people about what happened and gave a full report. Even though i was anxious, i remembered this is a life and remained calm to explain what happened.\n",

I'd like to share that with you and continue the conversations we had. I think we share a common goal and I'd like to see how we can help each other achieve it. Do you have any dietary restrictions? What is comfort food to you?\n",
      "I think I'd share something personal about myself, in my case that would probably be a brief description of my experience with cancer. Not getting too much into specifics probably, but talking about what kind of cancer I had, how long I was in treatment, and how my world view has changed in response.\n",
      "I've had differences with a specific nurse I've worked with who's been know to have an attitude and be annoyed when her patient's need something/assist. I dealt with her/this for over 2 years. I remained civil with her, didn't not raise my voice. I met the patient's needs as best as I could. If this nurse was being unruly, I'd simply reach out to the DOR and address her behavior there.\n",
      "I am a creative laid-back type of go I'm mostly a introvert so I don't go out much but I do like to travel\n",
      "Being a good parent means you need to teach your child the morals of what is right and what is wrong. Setting limits and being consistent are the keys to good discipline. Be kind and firm when enforcing those rules. Focus on the reason behind the child’s behavior. And make it an opportunity to learn for the future, rather than to punish for the past. \n",
      "Great parents are playful parents, ones who always remember how important it is to have fun with their kids. That doesn't mean, of course, that moms and dads need to be nonstop entertainers or amuse their kids every minute of the day. What it means is embracing the joy of a child's world and sharing it by being part of their play.\n",
      "Dear www,\n",
      "I know that we both have experienced some of the same childhood trauma though the levels of severity between your experience and mine are different. i just wanted you to know that sometimes when I'm not comfortable sharing about how I feel bout it with my brother, I do trust you enough to talk to you about it.\n",
      "A good parent is open and nonjudgmental to their kid. They have to understand that this is a learning human and that this little person will make mistakes. A good parent also freely gives love, encouragement, and attention.\n",
      "I love going to the beach and if the weather is right and it's early enough, I go fishing.  You should come some time!  It's extremely relaxing and absolutely no make-up is needed!\n",
      "Being a good parent involves being very involved and active in their child's life. It's not always about the material things that you can provide to your child it involves your time and attention. Its the the little things that mean the most that show that you are their for your child not just monetarily but in all aspects of their life.\n",
      "If I wanted to be be closer to them I will definitely share my adventurous experiences. Things like skydiving, deep sea diving, parasailing etc. are experiences not a lot of people engage in but they love to hear about them especially if told in a entertaining way. Since I have dabbled in all of these, I like to tell people about them which makes me instantly likeable. Plus I always encourage them to try them as well which makes me more relatable.\n",
      "I would share my high school experience with an acquaintance if I was trying to become closer to them. We could bond over our similar or different high school experiences. I would say \"I went to a special magnet school that was healthcare-related. It was such a hard school and we only had two hundred and one kid's graduate. So many people dropped out. It was crazy, the workload was just insane. It's hard to describe, but it was just crazy. We didn't have any of the major sports like football or basketball, just track, field, golf, swimming, and tennis. It was an interesting experience\" I would listen to my acquaintance talk about their experiences and we would bond over any similarities and can discuss more about differences.\n",
      "There was this one notable instance where a co-worker was trying to get my attention, and they did try to \"hug\" me and I just shook my head and said \"no.\" to them. The aftermath of this was I told a manager and they ended up telling the head manager, and it was mostly swept under the rug so to speak. I tried to make nice with this co-worker after the fact anyway.\n",
      "A good parent listens to their child and doesn't dismiss their concerns. A good parent supports the child and makes them feel loved and supported. A good parent doesn't spoil their child and leads by example.\n",

      "The hardest time I had at work was my first year working with children. I did not know how to control the group at first. The children took advantage and walked all me. What I did to make my job easier is to learn how to do childcare and learn behavior techniques at the college and train the school training meeting. I was then able to control my group and have them do the activities that I was trained to do with the group.\n",
      "I think a good parent is able to provide for their children in many ways. This can be economically, in being able to provide quality shelter, food, and clothing and even emotionally in giving support. They also are invested in their child's education and future.\n",
      "Hi D,\n",
      "I've always admired that you have been able to handle times of difficulty with calm, especially when it's work-related. My mentee K really appreciated how you helped her when she was having some difficulties balancing her new baby and her job. Recently I've been having some trouble managing my boss as she is very demanding, and I immediately thought of you as someone to reach out to for advice. Would you have time for a coffee next Friday at 10? It'll be my treat.\n",
      "Hi friend, I have been thinking about you lately. How is everything going? Do you need anything? I haven't been able to reach out as much as I'd like to for the past couple of years. Let's get together soon.\n",
      "The challenge I faced occurred when I worked at a fast-food restaurant a few years ago. What made this job challenging was the fact that I wasn't skilled enough to use the cash register and no one trained me enough on how to use it correctly. This led to me shortchanging one or more people and feeling confused for a while. I overcame this problem by getting a degree in science ( this degree includes a lot of math classes) and honing my math skills. Now I don't have to work at a fast-food restaurant anymore and I actually have a job that's respectable.\n",
      "I had a challenge in the workplace related to employee behavior and how detrimental it was, since it effected not only the work itself but the environment as it became toxic and negative to work in. It was challenging to address it as it seemed that nobody wanted to acknowledge this issue while the signs of a toxic workplace were apparent, such as gossip, slander, negativity, and name calling.\n",
      "The difficult challenge I experienced in the workplace was working in Amazon warehouse having to stand for 10 hours straight and no sitting.\n",
      "I know someone who is a very good parent and is a friend of mine. They are a good parent because they also have a friendship with their kids. Their kids feel comfortable talking to them about anything in their lives without judgement. Their parent never talks down to them and respects them as their own person and supports them no matter how the do or do not feel about a path that their child chooses in life.\n",
      "When volunteering at a lab, I had to pick up a concept that I had no experience with in three months, so I could produce something for my master's thesis. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to complete my thesis on time, so I had to create and stick to a very strict timeline to not only submit something by the end of the semester, but to also understand what I was doing and why I was doing it.\n",
      "A difficult situation was when I was in a 1:1 meeting with my supervisor. The conversation had been going well but then she had suddenly brought up a random comment made by someone else in the office who worked in a different department than my colleagues and I. It had been that she had noticed that we were on our phones in between phone calls (as a phone clinic). Never before had this been an issue or our work ethic or numbers/metrics called into question. I overcame it by staying calm and explaining the situation.\n",
      "I love to write, mainly fiction in the horror comedy genera. I love to do comedy but I have failed to make this a career in the past. I also like long walks in the rain and riding bikes.\n",
      "Several employees in my department had recently left, so I had to pick up work that I wasn't used to doing. For example, I had to use AutoCAD to do some preliminary drawings. I'm not an engineer, and I hadn't used AutoCAD since freshman year of college, so I wasn't too familiar with it. It was difficult at first, but I took the initiative to watch some online tutorials and even found my old textbook. I went through the process step-by-step and was able to complete a drawing. I asked my boss to help me review it  when I was done so I could catch any mistakes before I did any more. In the end, I successfully learned the process.\n",
      "A good parent have many characteristics. It is someone who shows love to their family and their children. They can problem solve the issues that arise. When times are stressful, they are able to handle the situation and remain calm. They prioritize their family over anything else.\n",
      "They're always loving and supportive. Even when they need to discipline a child, they do it in a compassionate and understanding way. They focus on making sure the child understands why what they did was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "At every point, they should be there as their child's rock. A place the child can turn to for support and safety whenever they need it.\n",
      "Someone who is very caring and patient. They understand their role and do it to the fullest without complaining. Is a hardworker in all they do. They are nice most of the time eventhough they may feel down. They attend to their children and be their for them no matter what.\n",
      "I would explain that a good parent is someone who encourages their children. Someone who tries to teach their children about religion, and discipline. Someone who teaches their children how to love and respect.\n",
      "Hi XYZ,\n",
      "I hope you're doing well! I thought of you this weekend when I went home the other day. You mentioned your grandparents retired in the same town, and I made a trip to the cafe you told me about last week! It was so good and I can't wait to go back. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n",
      "A good parent listens to their child and has a conversation. They possess patience and understanding when handling difficult situations, and doesn't dismiss or downplay the feelings of their child. A good parent doesn't have children to keep a relationship or fulfill their selfish needs. They also allow their child to enjoy their childhood and not take on the duties of the adult.\n",
      "I had to face a boss that was constantly undermining me or treating me different because I was a woman. I stood my ground and kept asserting my place. If he tried to send guys to pick up equipment because it was \"heavy\", I would volunteer and lift the \"heavy\" equipment just like the guys did.\n",
      "I would open up about a fear of mine. Be a bit vulnerable but not in a way where it comes off like I'm trying to manipulate them by victimizing myself. It's more about a Universal fear I need to overcome in order to achieve a goal. \n",

      "This gives them a chance to open about themselves, and, in return, I can encourage them. I can support them.\n",

      "I had a disagreement with a peer who was junior to me but whom I did not directly manage. We had the same manager, but she was out on leave at the time. I had to give feedback on something this person did which was wrong, but they were getting really defensive. I learned that sometimes I have to pick my battles and some just aren't worth it.\n",
      "Back when I was in my freshmen year of college, my best friend and I became co-managers at a frozen yogurt shop in town. We pretty much ran the place together, which the owner was busy taking care of his mother's diner business. This wasn't a chain frozen yogurt shop, he opened up his own in town. So the only boss above us was him. \n",

      "I remember it was summer and I was in the city with my friend. Right before we were heading into the movie theater, I get a phone call from one of my fellow employees, B. She was saying how X is really late, that she and the employee that's finishing up her shift tried calling and texting him. Nothing, no response for the texts and straight to voicemail for the phone calls. We had no other way to contact him. After talking a bit, I tried doing the same and got the same results as well. I called B back and thankfully the employee who was finishing her shift offered to stay a few hours extra so B wouldn't be alone. Which I was so grateful for because it would've ended up in a disaster if B got a rush of kids coming and had to deal with it by herself.\n",

      "My other co-manager was busy with her second job, I knew there would be no way to brainstorm with her so I decided to handle it on my own. While my friend went inside to get our seats, I stayed out in the lobby, calling all the other employees and sending out a text in the work group chat to see if anyone can come in to finish the closing shift with B since I wouldn't be heading back into town anytime soon. Thankfully again, someone else was able to help out and that problem was resolved. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning I was opening the store with my fellow co-manager and we discussed what happened. No one has heard from X and we decided to contact our boss about it as well. We ended up sending him texts saying if it wasn't an emergency to please contact us by the end of the week. If it is an emergency, please let us know and we'll figure out his employment status later when the emergency is dealt with. X ended up just being lazy, decided not to work anymore when we got in contact with him and we gave him a stern lecture he can't do that, if he want to quit, let us know, don't go MIA. Overall, the situation was definitely stressful and difficult because it was the first time I experienced firing an employee and one of the few times I wasn't in town to help an employee as well.\n",
      "There are several traits that would make someone a good parent. One trait is compassion. Having compassion for your child, when he or she makes mistakes or struggles with a shortcoming gives them room to grow and love their imperfections. Also, being supportive is good parenting. Being supportive, even when you don't really understand your child's hopes and dreams, will give them confidence in doing whatever it is that they want to achieve. Lastly, being an honest parent is good parenting. Telling your child the truth about life, making mistakes and other things will keep them from falling into the same troubles that you may have experienced.\n",
      "My mom is a very good parent. She was always there for us kids, and she always helped us in a good way. She let us explore things, but told us when she thought something wasn't good. She have us freedom while still protecting us from harm. And she instilled good values in us, values of ethics and integrity.\n",
      "A good parent is a parent that sacrifices themselves for their child. They take care of them emotionally, mentally, and physically. They are always there when the child needs them. A good parent should love their child unconditionally, regardless of what they do.\n",
      "I think my mother is a very good parent. She is someone that accepts her children for who they are. She wants them to express themselves. She also encourages them to pursue their dreams, regardless of whether or not it'll make them a lot of money. Of course she does try to steer you in a direction that she thinks would be the most secure for you, but she always tells you that its solely her opinion and that it's up to me to decide what kind of life I want to live. Most importantly, she stresses the importance of happiness. She always pushes us to find something that makes us happy as little as it may be. She is a great listener and she always lifts you from your failures. These are characteristics of a great parent.\n",
      "What makes someone a good parent is the ability to understand that their child will eventually be their own person. When one is aware of the fact that they are creating an entirely new human being, it allows them to be more emotionally responsive to the child's needs.\n",
      "Typically people tend to trust you more when you ask them for advice. so i would look for an aspect of my life/work i need advice with. lets say i am trying to decide what concert to go to or what colour of t-shirt i should wear tomorrow. when you ask these type of questions people typically think you trust them so they automatically trust you more\n",
      "Hello, I would talk to them about my interests and how I like things from video games, to tv shows, to sports etc. I would also discuss how much I like to go out. I am a very active person that also likes to exercise, but most important of all, I am a kind person. These are some of the things I would want the other person to know.\n",
      "A difficult challenge I experienced in the workplace happened 3 months ago when I needed to meet a deadline. I was already behind because I was working on more than one project at one time. I eventually completed the challenge but needed overtime hours in order to complete and meet the deadline.\n",

      "One recent difficulty I had in the workplace was during a painting moment with a client. I had to step out briefly in order to take a call from my doctor, so I had other coworkers keep an eye on him. When I returned, the client had covered himself and the walls in paint. This moment was difficult for me because it appeared to me that my teammates had disregarded me when I asked them to watch said client. I overcame this by remembering that they likely did their best, but without knowing the specific behaviors of my client, there were likely to mishaps.\n",
      "Hi, I'd like to let you know that although it may seem like I am distant at times, I enjoy your company. I feel like I am a bother so that's why I don't engage as often. This is something I don't disclose openly, but I wanted to let you know if it feels like I don't like you, because that's just not true.\n",
      "I was working with an aggressive animal, who outweighed me and who's owner was unable to muzzle them safely. I worked with my doctor to come up with a plan that would not put either of us in danger and would allow us to not only build some semblance of trust with our patient, but also allow us to get them properly vaccinated should anything negative happen. We were able to safely place a muzzle, neck restraint, and administer a sedative without the patient lunging/showing teeth as he had done previously. It took nearly an hour and we missed lunch block entirely that day, but I can now work without a muzzle or medication to administer whatever I need to the patient.\n",
      "A good parent is attentive and understanding. Remains emotionally stable and is a constant source of comfort for a child. One who balances allowing a child some growth and independence but keeping safe boundaries.\n",
      "As an application support specialist in a community bank, most challenges are in regards to new computer software that is being implemented by our company. 1 certain application would not work properly for nearly 2 weeks. In those weeks, I would dread night and day and the problem has always been at the back of my head. I'm the kind of person who is persistent in tasks, and would you use all the resources available for me to resolve that one issue. In the 3rd week, I was able to get a hold of the support team for that software and have them resolve the issue in a conference call with me and the end-user. It shouldn't have taken that long to fix the issue. At the end of the day, I was happy it was resolved.\n",
      "I was working in the HR department and I had to onboard 80 new employees.  Usually we only had about 30 a month, so getting a huge influx of employees created a large backlog.  There was an extreme amount of paperwork that needed to be done and there wasn't enough time during the work days to do it all.  I ended up going in on weekends and arriving hours early in the mornings to get the paperwork done on time for orientation.  It was a lot of work but I kept at it and put in a lot of extra time to get it done so we didn't fall behind.\n",
      "A senior manager had quit right in the middle of a project with limited people on board already. I was randomly flung into roles that I had no experience with and had to learn on the fly while placating a panicking client. Fortunately, I was able to pick up skills as I went, and the experience fast tracked my client facing skills, which was something I had been heavily lacking prior to the crisis.\n",
      "In my opinion I think that being a good parent means respecting your children, giving them space to explore, and allowing them to be themselves. I also think it means spending time with them and letting them know you are in their life to support them and to raise a good person. I think it's important to show them compassion, love, empathy and treating others with respect.\n",

      "It was difficult to learn something I had never done before. I had to talk to a lot of people just to do 1 thing. I had to remember the order of things.\n",
      "Being a good parents means to always be there for your kids through thick and thin. You support them through everything and the things they want tot pursue. You need to be patient and be understanding to know where your child is coming from. Also have fun and make a lot of memories. It's also good to record the things you want to with your child.\n",
      "I would like you to know more about my family.  I am an older sister of two.  I have a younger brother named Toby and a brother Nick that has passed.  I have four children and two grandchildren.  My parents are alive and well and we are all very close.\n",
      "I would share my basic views about the world. I am a bit of a philosophical person and I would casually share with them I am a \"go with the flow\" type of person. I feel that it eases any tensions and lets them know that I am not one to judge a person. Most people are fearful of judgement, usually for no reason. I figure that if I could eliminate that tension, it would open up conversation more and I could get to know that person for who they really are, not just the facade that a person would put up just so people can like them.\n",
      "I think my mother is a very good parent. When I was younger she was very attentive to me and my older sister. We knew that she loved and cared for us, that's all you really need a parent to do. She'd feed us, bathe us, and just try to make us happy. As I got older and started having more problems related to school and just problems in my personal life she was very understanding\n",
      "I'd tell this person about my memories of spending quality time with my family, from when I was a kid until now.  I'd want to impart to them the importance of family and loved ones in my life and how much being with them means to me.  I'd tell them about some of the fun and loving memories that I have of my family, as well as a few of the tougher times, when my family and I relied on each other and got through it - advising each other, leaning on one another, but most of all, finding love by being united and together.\n",
      "I just want to say that I care about you a lot! I really appreciate your presence in my life; even though we don't talk a lot, you just being around has made so many aspects of being in this place so much better for me.\n",
      "I would share information about my personal life, including my values, aspirations, significant events in my life. I would also talk about things we have in common so we can build more genuine rapport with each other.\n",
      "I believe what makes a person a good parent is always being there for your children. It is important that kids know that they always have someone to turn to. Let you children know that you are interested in their thoughts and ideas and show up when it is important to them. Everyone always talks about how busy they are but understand you should NEVER be to busy for your children. Be there, be present. Let them know, no matter what you are there whenever they need it.\n",
      "A good parent prioritizes the quality of life for their child. To maintain this quality of life, a parent knows they must take care of themselves.

      "One of the most difficult challenges I have experienced in the workplace was when the firm where I worked was growing and expanding and opening offices in other cities but my department was not growing and had in fact had lost two positions which left just me to do quadruple the work. It was stressful. Since my calls for additional staffing were ignored I had to find ways to streamline processes to get things done. One example, I was responsible for training new hires on time-entry procedures so I created an asynchronous training presentation.\n",
      "I was working in a computer lab. I was responsible for issuing computer stations and answering any questions related to computer or printers. Well, I arrived to work and there was a situation already happening. A large male was sitting at a station without his shirt or shoes on. He was very sweaty and had a strong odor. Other patrons were complaining to the staff. The staff was afraid to approach him and ask him to put on his clothes. They were afraid of him because he was big and appeared threatening. I was told the situation and I said I will handle it. I approached him in a calm manner. I greeted him and stated my name. I told him that I worked here. I said sir I am going to have to ask you to put on your shirt and shoes in this establishment. Everyone must be fully clothed to use the computers. He said ok but I was just leaving anyway. He put on his stuff and he left about 5-10 minutes later. I handled it with dignity. I did not talk loud. I talked in a low calm voice. I did not try to embarrass him. I kept everything on a professional level. I think he appreciated it.\n",
      "A parent is someone who is able to guide you in the right direction. There must be a balance. Parents are nurturing but not too much because the world is a tough place and a child must not be too soft. Parents should be able to discipline a child and teach them right from wrong.\n",
      "I was managing a contact and the contractor submitted a change order for a large amount.  I had to determine how and why the change occurred.  I had to brief the customer the necessity of the change and impacts to the schedule.  Once I had approval for the change, I negotiated a cost, which was based on the actual work of the added scope change.  The actual change was about half the cost of what the contractor proposed.  The contractor inflated costs and scope of work.\n",
      "I just wanted you to know that I quit my job and I am starting my own business like you advised the last time. I did my own research, reached out to the manufacturers and they are on board and willing to give their hundred percent to partner with me.

      "A difficult challenge I experienced in the workplace was receiving different messages from different bosses about my duties. I would be told to do one task by one boss, then after completing the project, I would be told by another that I should have done a different task instead. It made it hard for me to know what my role in the company truly was, as the tasks requested were both in and out of my job description. It was frustrating because some tasks I was neither trained nor prepared to deal with. I overcame it by talking to my original boss about my duties and clarifying my position within the company.\n",
      "A time I was faced with a difficult challenge was when I was nominated by my supervisors to give a speech at work. The thing that made the task challenging would be the fact that I get nervous and hate given speech of any sort. To make matters worse it was to be in front of the Corprate office.\n",
      "I am an only child, and all of my cousins are older than me. I had friends at school, but at home, I entertained myself with books. Due to this, I have always found refuge in fiction. I love to read, write, and watch TV/movies. What are your hobbies?\n",
      "One of the most important things you can make a child feel, is heard. What a child says is very important. Don’t shut down their words or beliefs, instead, praise them for speaking up and then educate them if they are being ignorant. Don’t make a child feel less than a human for speaking up for themselves. Any ideas that they have are beautiful and should be treated as such. Let a child have a say in their own life. As soon as they start to understand language, even if they can’t speak, ask them for their input on things like clothes to wear for the day, what they want to eat, etc. Honor their voice before it’s too late and they lose it.\n",
      "A good parent is the master of balance. They know how to give just the right amount of discipline, the right amount of tough love, and the right amount of independence to their child.\n",
      "I was asked to fix a very different sewing machine like I had not worked on before so I studied how it worked and acted.  I was able to eventually figure out what the problem was and fix it.\n",
      "Someone who is a good parent is also a good role model. They act the same way they want their children to act. They would teach their children family values, God, and education. It is important for a child to be respectful and have accountability and responsibility at an early age. By teaching children the importance of family values and God, they will be able to follow a better path whatever they choose.\n",
      "Needs to be vigilant and caring. Responsible and cares about the child's future. Cares about the child's education and extracurriculars. Ensures that the child lives a healthy lifestyle. Motivates without being too pushy.\n",
      "I like swords and I'm part of a group that meets every week.  I enjoy swords a lot and I can talk about it all the time.  I also look for information to help me be better in sword fighting.  I also collect action figures such as transformers and zoids.\n",
      "One point I was facing a difficult challenge was when timelines for a project were pushed up due to Covid vaccine regulations. I work in pharma and had a big hassle when Vaccine demand rose exponentially. Our projects typically take a year to years, however, we had to finish the project in months. This was very difficult as time was not on our side. We overcame this by hiring contractors and working longer hours. I worked very efficiently and hard during that time.\n",

      "One difficult challenge I've experienced in the workplace was during my first time working on a closeout study. In this study, I worked with my Project Manager to ensure that all study equipment from different locations throughout the world were going to be returned back to our company. However, this was difficult as different countries had different regulations. It was tough to keep up and retrieve all paperwork necessary. To move forward with this task, I reached out to different departments at work whom I felt had the expertise. With the help of the logistics team as well as other Project Coordinators who've had similar experience, I was able to get through this challenge.\n",
      "Someone with an understanding of psychology, particularly developmental psychology and imprinting, and the empathy and life experience to apply this to their interactions with their child would be a good parent.\n",

      "I remember one time at work when I had to tell one of my colleagues and teammates that her ideas were mediocre. It was especially difficult because she was one of our organization's two Asian Americans at the time, and I didn't want to appear unsupportive of minorities, considering the fact that I myself identify as a racial minority.\n",
      "A difficult task I experienced in the workplace was when I was spontaneously put on a new project that needed to be completed soon. The project was focused on a sector I was not familiar with and I had to research and do this project on my own since one of the lead designers from that sector was not available for a few weeks. It was nerve-wracking and frustrating getting to learn everything new, and knowing that this isn't even part of my job/current sector.\n",

      "A good parent should have a good understanding of the common problems that arise during childhood. They should be fast to react to problems which need to be immediately addressed especially when it comes to emergencies. A good parent needs to understand how to provide healthy foods to a child. This includes a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables instead of junk food. These good eating habits may stick to adulthood. A good parent needs to be a good listener. They should be able to understand the needs and wants of the child.\n",
      "What makes a good parent is to be loving. Loving enough to put the baby first because they need much more help than you do. They would be there to comfort them in times of need while also supplying as much you can give. That is how a good parent is made.\n",
      "A good parent not only provides for their kids by providing financially but also dedicates quality time with their kids. A good parent think not only for what's good now but also 5, 10 and 15 years when it comes to deciding what's good for their kids.\n",

      "I am writing to ask your advice on something. Work has recently become somewhat challenging for me and I am curious what you think about the situation because I really value your input. My boss has been away for a large part of the less 6 months because of maternity leave and issues with unstable child-care, and as a result the day-to-day life in the office has been quite bad. People who depend on her presence for accountability have been slacking and making things more challenging for me, and I feel awkward about bringing this up as I'm not sure how to phrase it without putting some blame on my boss for being so absent. I really do want the best out of this situation but I don't think the extra work load is sustainable - what would you recommend I do here? Have you experienced something like this before? I think it's harder for me because I'm the type of person to jump in and do what needs to be done, sometimes at the expense of my own mental health, and I think others take advantage of that. I just hate leaving projects unfinished and if other people won't step up then I feel like I have to. What are your thoughts?\n",
      "I feel like being a good parent means putting your child first in all circumstances. Being calm, no yelling, no spanking and no cursing. Provide your child with everything they need to grow and develop into a happy healthy productive human. Read to them a lot. Always be willing to listen to them.\n",
      "To me, what makes a good parent is the ability to respect your child. It seems like such an obvious thing, but there are so many parents who have children that they claim they'll love wholly and completely no matter what as long as they're healthy and then turn around and throw them to the side if they come out as gay or transgender and there are parents out there who have children and try to control every aspect of their futures without taking into consideration what their child wants.\n",
      "I was dealing with an unsatisfied customer that would not work with me to come to a solution. It was very frustrating because any suggestions I had to make the situation right was not satisfying enough for them. It seemed as though they were just trying to make me feel bad.

      "Someone that I think is a great parent is my aunt. When I would spend time with their family when the kids were little, she was so patient and gentle with them. Specifically, whenever the children would do something that they should not be doing, she would say 'no thank you' and simply treat them with respect. It was less like a dictatorship than many parenting relationships seem to be.\n",
      "there are so many dimensions to being a good parent that it almost defies description.  Some of the aspects of being a good parent are even seemingly contradictory - for example, parenthood requires absolute selflessness, and yet it's important for children to see that their parents are complete individuals with lives and interests of their own.  Parents must be attentive and nurturing to their children, and yet also give them room to grow and develop apart from their parents.  Children should be encouraged to develop their own interests and activities, and sometimes parents should be there to support them and sometimes they should stay away, otherwise children will always see the activity or sport as an opportunity for parental praise and involvement, and will never learn how to enjoy sports and activities for their own sake.  The entire experience of parenthood is a constant process of balancing these two opposing desires - to hold a child to oneself and to let the child go.\n",
      "When I think of a good parent, I think of my own mother.  Good parents put their children first and let their kids be kids.  My mother always made sure I was cared for, I had what I needed, and went above and beyond to make sure I know I was valued and loved.  Growing up, I was allowed to be a child: to have an imagination, play with friends, and burdened by issues or problems my family may have been experiencing.\n",
      "I have enjoyed hiking with my mom from a young age. Throughout all these years, she has been my favorite hiking buddy and we have had many adventures together. These days, her work schedule keeps her pretty busy on the days that I am not busy, so we haven't had a chance to hike together much recently. I have been looking to meet someone new that enjoys hiking as much as me that would be up for some new outdoor adventures.\n",
      "some of my favorite hobbies are riding my motorcycle, longboarding, and painting. i rarely have time to do them though because i’m also a workaholic. i have two jobs: a pharmacy technician, and a movie theater employee. i don’t even need both jobs i just can’t bring myself to quit the theater for some reason and i actually need the other one to pay my rent.\n",
      "I started a second career as a elementary school teacher. Years had passed since I graduated college and received my certification. What I lacked in experience, I made up for by being extraordinarily prepared. As is customary, my principal entered my classroom unannounced to observe me. I was flustered and nervous. On top of that, the smart board that I had planned on using, for some reason, did not work when I put it on. So, I had to improvise and stay calm. In the end, the lesson was a success and my principal gave me great feedback.\n",
      "While she has plenty of flaws, like any parent, my mother was very encouraging and nourish towards me during my development.  While some mothers are \"soccer moms,\" she never pressured me to do things I didn't want to do, and encouraged me to pursue the interests I wanted to pursue.  She was always willing to listen and was very empathetic and compassionate, and those traits really made a difference in my development.  I wouldn't be the same person I am today if not for her.\n",
      "I believe a good parent is one who can find the balance of being your child's friend and their authority. A good parent has established expectations but can be lenient when necessary. They should be someone their child is completely comfortable coming to about any and all problems, and a good parent lets that be known. A good parent has fun with their children but knows boundaries as well.\n",
      "I had a  number of diffuculties throughout this time, but during this time, I was beginning my second year with the company and they decided to distance themselves from all of this. It was very isolating, which I hated. \n",

      "Part of my job as drilling aluminum pieces for greenhouses. We had drawings showing where and what size holes needed to be made. Unfortunately some of the drawings could be difficult to understand at first glance. I had to come up with ways to position the parts in the exact orientation as the drawing. This sometimes meant turning the drawings around so the top and bottom were reversed.\n",
      "Being a good parent means to be selfless and sacrifice your time and body constantly. You have to be willing to start living for your children.\n",
      "I grew up like a typical 80's kid, telling my mom i was going out to ride my bike and be out for hours. It was a different time.  She never worried about where i was or what I was getting up to, and I just enjoyed being outside playing with friends and having fun. It was just a simpler and I think a better time. Family vacations every year were a highlight of my summer, I loved going to the beach.\n",
      "I think a good parent is someone who is able to openly communicate with their child. Good communication is key to a good relationship. I also think it is vital for parents to be supportive of their children’s dreams and choices. If a child feels supported they are more likely to come to their parents with their problems rather than just hiding them, which could lead to major harm. Also if one little thing like your child’s sexuality or gender identity is enough for you to stop loving them, did you ever really love them in the first place? Overall I think communication and support are the two biggest keys to being a good parent.\n",
      "The volume of work without backup support.  The lack of being able to take a day off or a reasonable vacation.  The question of not receiving a check or if by chance you will receive a check.\n",
      "I worked as a waitress at IHOP. When I took people's orders, sometimes I would have difficulty what they were saying, especially if there were many people. I overcame it by repeating customers' orders back to them to double-check, notating for large parties, and working on understand the regional accent, as well as learning a little Spanish.\n",
      "In my last job, I made a quick reference for a college. I printed out a page of a database we frequently used and highlighted important information so that she could know how to interpret the information in case she needed it for a phone call. My boss was impressed and asked me to make one for everybody, so I did. I did it the exact same way as the first, by hand, using colored pens. My boss ended up being very upset because the references were made by hand instead of using the computer because she believed it should be obvious that I use the computer. It wasn't obvious to me, so in the future, I would ask my boss whether they wanted it to be exactly the same as the first reference I'd made, or if they'd wanted me to make changes to the structure, formatting, or delivery.\n",
      "Hi Debby, I hope that this email finds you well.\n",
      "I want to share something about myself and I hope that you will understand. I have always been a bit difficult to get along with mainly because I like being alone. If I don't get enough alone time, I tend to get a bit anxious and short tempered. I need my alone time and I wanted to tell you that I appreciate my friendship with you because of how understanding you are and how to get the fact that I need and want time to myself.\n",
      "One time I was dealing with an aggressive and unfriendly coworker. She said some mean words to me, I stood up for myself, and then I quit the job.\n",
      "I think what makes a good parent is not just doing your best, but going above and beyond what you think is expected as a parent. You have to be their role model and show them what it means to be a healthy individual and partner. What's most important is expressing your love and emotions. Be patient and acknowledge their feelings.\n",
      "Hello, I wanted to share some things about myself with you. Something I'd like to share is how much singing means to me. Since I was a young girl, music and singing has meant the world to me. When I was younger, I would sing causally for fun. In middle and high school, I was in choir and it was a great experience for me. One of my most treasured memories from my childhood is singing in front of a thousand people at my middle school's talent show and winning third place. Now as a young adult, I take pride in the fact that I can sing more in front of people as I sing at my church.\n",
      "A time I faced a challenge in the workplace that I had to overcome was when it started flooding at my workplace. It was after we had closed the store and it was just my co-worker and I closing the store. We were cleaning up and getting ready to close when all of a sudden, water started spraying out from under our ice machine. It was going everywhere and we had to act quick to make sure it didn't get worse. We both sprung to action. My co-worker was mopping as fast as he could while I was trying to turn off the machine. I finally got the machine turned off and the water stopped spraying. We had to stay awhile and clean things up but we managed to everything pretty dry.\n",
      "I would probably talk with them about my own life and their life, asking about career goals, current going ons, any notable events occuring within the week, and anything to come in life. This would also involve checking in with their general well-being at the moment and just seeing how someone is while giving personal information about yourself that is honest and connected.\n",
      "I think my dad is a really great parent. Sure, he makes mistakes like other parents do. But overall his heart is in the right place, and I feel like he truly supports my decisions in life and gives me advice that helps me further his goals and not his personal agenda for who I should be.\n",
      "A good parent is someone who not only looks after the welfare of their children, but does so in such a way that they are able to maintain their individuality while learning how to serve others.\n",
      "My friend is a really great mom to her son. He's toddler age now and she always made sure to talk to him often and in ways he could understand. She really helped him handle his own emotions.\n",
      "I would like to share about my family. Growing up I had married parents and a disabled sister. My mom's side of the family was very large but my dad's was very small. We would always have parties on the holidays and birthdays, and for the most part I got along with my extended family pretty well. My relationship with my mother has always been more complicated, but I love my family.\n",
      "A good parent works on the lives of their children, their training and development as they grow into adulthood. Their brain, their creativity and education, their security, wealth management and pursuit of happiness\n",

I think in doing so we will be able to improve our lives by completing our goals, but that doesn't mean we should stop there. We should continue to make new goals and meet them.\n",
      "One big challenge I faced in the workplace was speaking up when I needed help with a task or if I wanted to express my opinion. I was able to overcome this by speaking to my co-workers and slowly letting them know I needed help.\n",
      "They are very compassionate and understanding. They are a safe space for their child, while also teaching them about the important aspects of life.\n",
      "A good parent is someone who can guide their children through life while instilling good values within them. A parent that does this will have to be honest, and good natured and be willing to engage with their children in a way that treats them like individual human beings and not some constantly evolving task. A child is not a job. A child is not a hobby. A child is a human being.\n",
      "The most valuable traits of a good parent are patience and understanding.  A good parent must listen and try to understand what their child is going through.  Never try to push your children into anything they are not interested in but have the patience to let them find their own paths in life.\n",
      "When I waited tables I had to serve the owner of the restaurants of this namesake. I had never done something like before but I made sure when performing my duties as a waiter to be at the top of my game and be as attentive as possible. I guess this would be akin to hosting an event for your superiors in a way. I was definitely anxious to do this but just kept on focusing on providing the best experience despite my anxiety. Overall the owner was pleased with my waiting on him.\n",
      "A good parent is one who is patient, respectful, and kind to their child and teaches their child to treat others in that same manner. A good parent is also supportive of their child and encourages and nurtures their curiosity and passions.\n",
      "I had a baby at the beginning of the school year as I was moving to a new school. Without really knowing what the curriculum or students were really like, I had to prepare plans for my substitute. When I got back, my students were in a much different place than I expected. They weren't understanding much and their behavior left a lot to be desired. I initially thought that I would need to teach more to be able to help my students learn. This lead to a lot of stress because I had to prepare a lot more material for my lessons. I soon realized, however, that my students couldn't handle sitting and learning for that long, and I had to change up the way I taught so that they could spend more time working independently or in groups. I am much less stressed now and am able to plan so much quicker than before.\n",
      "A difficult situation that I once faced in the workplace was working with two co workers that put very little effort into things and tried to take credit for everything they did. When one slacked off, the other person covered for them. One day, I knew a big project was being assigned to my group and didn't want them doing nothing and taking the credit. I made it know that I was the only one that wanted the responsibility and did the project before they were actually aware that it was even ready to begin to work on.\n",
      "i think the mom from sweet home septuplets is an awesome mom she works and spends time with her kids. she brings them places from them to have experiences and doesn't leave anyone out. i do not know how she does it she must have help because i cant do have the things she does and i have only 3 boys not 6 girls so i think she is a rockstar she never leaves anyone out and makes each and everyone of them feel special al the time i wish i had her superpower\n",
      "Someone else was making a decision about a way we would do a project and I had no say.  I gave my opinion but it didn't matter and the decision was not the way I would have gone.  I had to just suck it up and go along with it, even though the person making the decision did not know what they were doing.\n",
      "I have a special connection to playing the piano, it's something that I can do when I'm in any mood at all, and it always improves it or at least helps me cope with the mood I'm in, if negative. It lets me escape from the world. \n",

      "I was managing a lounge in Baton Rouge. I had this boss that was the owner of the club. He was spending everything we made on drugs. I came to realize that any day our doors would be closed. I was put in the position of trying to sell all the liqueur stock back to either the supplier or another lounge. It was off putting to have to call these people and ask for their help. In the end I managed to sell all (a lot of booze) except for three bottles of Dom Perignon. I was given them for my last check since there was no money after I paid all the other employees.\n",
      "Hey, I actually have a hobby of making my own beer. I wanted to know if maybe you wanted to come over and try some. I'll cook some salmon and we can chat and get to know each other over some of the beers I make. If you're interested I can actually giv you a rundown on how beer or any alcohol is actually made. It's a good get to know you project that I love to teach others about you. Obviously you're someone I appreciate enough to want to teach you about this interesting craft.\n",
      "In college, I started off as a music major. It was a really good feeling for me knowing I was good enough to get into the college of music. After a year, I realized I didn't want to be a high school band director for all of my life, there was no room for growth. So I became an electrical engineer major. Only because I took a career quiz and that's what it told me I should be. I enjoyed school, and now I have an amazing career.\n",
      "I would talk to them about my family and boyfriend. Additionally maybe travel and work too. I would try to find experiences that were relatable to the other person. I would talk in a joking and fun manner.\n",
      "After I was retired I went to college I studied criminal justice. I was interested in that area because of the problems some of my siblings had growing. They were all younger than me. I was a teenager when they were born so there is some age difference. After finishing my degree I could see both sides of the issues they had. If I had this knowledge earlier I could have prevent some of the problems they face after my mother's death\n",
      "I would tell them about a friendship that I had. It is a friendship that has changed me a lot and has a lot to do with why I am the way I am. It was a very bad friendship that makes me have trouble with people, so talking about this would hopefully help them understand me.\n",
      "a good parent is someone who truly cares for their child. you do not have children to take care of you or control, and need to accept the hardships that come with parenting. using parenting styles to help your child grow into a great person who feels loved and knows how to love and care for others is so important.\n",
      "I think my Mother has some quality traits that I would like to use as a good parent. She always puts me first no matter what. She worked most of her life to give us a great life, we were not rich in anyway but I didn't know that until I understood, she would provide everything we needed. She is super loving and goes out of her way to care for us even though we live two hours away I can always count on her to come to me. When I was younger she didn't push us to try to do any extra curricular activities that we didn't want to do.\n",
      "Being a good parent is exhausting, but not rocket science.  My friend and his wife are great parents.  They both work but when they are home, they are home.  Not working.  Not on social media.  They are WITH their two boys, ages 6 months and 4 years.  They don't even turn on the television until after the boys are in bed.  Just be there for and with your kids.  That shows your love more than anything.\n",
      "I think what makes a good parent is not black and white. Every baby, child, teenager, young adult, adult and every parent are different and need to be treated uniquely. So what makes a good parent is relative. But I think overall being understanding, compassionate, showing love and respect and overall doing your best to ensure your child is safe and taken care of is the best anyone can do. It’s not always easy, it’s sometimes downright terrifying and horrible, but you will get through it. And the love for your very own child is the best gift in the world.\n",
      "I would want you to know that i once you're apart of my life and i have love for you, you will always have a place in my life. As long as you don't try to hurt me, not matter what happens between us, or how many years it has been, I will always be there.\n",

On that day day however he asked for a whole lot more I men awhole lot more we lost over 100 employees that day including people that i w orked with for years, it wa a dark day.  After the mass layoff I went to my boss the COO and asked if I could have the rest of he day he handed me 1k and told me it's not from me your buying.  I;ll never forget how sad I was on that day. P.S. we got fubard that afternoon.\n",
      "What makes a good parents are several things.  You have to be caring, understanding, and most of all willing to learn.  You will teach your children many things, not only through what you tell them, but also how you act, how you treat others, and how you carry yourself.  My mother, personally, taught me so much without having to explain much. At a young age, I saw her work everyday, no matter what, to provide for our family. She was dealt with many obstacles, sickness, my brother (an unruly child) and sure, I saw her cry from time to time, but she never gave up.  She dealt with death and abuse.  She still went to work everyday and gave us the best life she could.  I didn't see it when I was a teenager, but now that I'm an adult with children of my own, I know that she did what she needed to do for us to thrive.  She put us first and herself second, constantly.  My mother now is my best friend. She never judges me. She gives me guidance, love and support, and sometimes when needed, a much needed talking to.\n",
      "I would try to share with them that I am normal and light-hearted or fun loving, but as long as that fun is not a drug or dangerous situation. Also that I like to go places and experience things. I guess you could say I value experiences over things. Not sure of how one would actually say that but overall that is what I would try to achieve.\n",
      "A good parent is patient above all.  Children can get on your every nerve with behaviors that are totally appropriate and natural, yet trying to the adults around them.  A good parent can handle this with grace and patience.\n",
      "Something that has been an ongoing challenge for me at my current job is the work environment and culture. I work with a small group of women, many of whom struggle to get along well. Because I try to be impartial and stick mainly to my work, I have become the default person that my coworkers come to when they are experiencing frustrations with other women in our workplace. This has made it very hard for me to do my job, and I often feel like I am being forced to pick sides in debates that do not directly pertain to the job I am being asked to do. It is frustrating for me to go to work every day, knowing that my coworkers will attempt to rope me into gossip and complaints about one another. I have been doing my best to remain impartial and supportive of all of my coworkers, but I really think that work culture and environment have a direct impact on the kind of job employees are able to do. I don't think that we as a staff are doing ourselves a service by engaging in these behaviors. I would like to work for a company in which this is not an issue.\n",
      "So what you've gotta understand is that your kid is gonna be their own person. You want to raise them a certain way, you want to teach them certain things as they grow, but you've gotta leave room for your kid to be their own person -- don't try to mold them into who you think they are, or think they should be. Let them be who they are.\n",

      "& for the gods' sake, if they turn out queer, ACCEPT THEM JUST AS THEY ARE.\n",
      "What makes a good parent is having an open, curious mind and a willingness to learn with a child. You have to be willing to learn things and adapt to new situations because children are constantly curious and changing and you have to be able to change with them. You have to be able to nurture their mind and curiosity about the world and encourage them in healthy areas and discourage them in unhealthy areas, but not in the, \"because I'm the parent and I said so,\" way, but in a way that actually explains why you're doing what you're doing and communicate that on a level that the child can understand. You have to teach them and be willing to admit when you don't know what you're talking about and be willing to learn with them. You have to be able to accept that they won't always be what you want them to be and that that's not necessarily a failure on your part or theirs, and seeing it as either will likely damage your relationship with them.\n",
      "Many years ago I got a job in an OTB (off track betting). Betting is very old fashioned with cash boxes. The bets are computerized, but the money is not. It is all in cash and has to be hand counted. I had never done that and had a terrible time. So my fiancee went and got about twenty dollars in change and we would sit at home every night when I got out of training and practice for hours. I got it down right after a while, and ended up as the assistant at the off track with a raise and great hours.\n",
      "I want to share some things that have helped me in my career. I have learned that I have to do away with my pride and ask for help whenever I have questions. I have become much more humble since working here. Even though I am a naturally shy person and it can be hard for me to speak up I am able to push myself every day and this has made me stronger.\n",
      "I actually wouldn't say I overcame this because I was let go as a result. But, it was still a challenge. My manager retired and a new manager was hired. And he and I were very different. And he basically didn't like me much and tried very hard to make things challenging for me.\n",
      "A good parent is someone that is selfless, loving, caring, nurturing, responsible. Is someone that puts their child first.\n",
      "I think it would make sense to talk about something I'm passionate about, like a hobby, because it's something that's engaging and has genuine, authentic interest behind it.  In my case I'd probably talk about mixed martial arts training because it's one of my main activities.  There are a lot of people who have sort of combat sports or martial arts experience when they are younger so maybe it could be a shared interest to discuss.  I wouldn't typically have a discussion like this over email, but maybe I would bring it up by talking about a recent event that took place, or a training seminar I went to.\n",
      "One time when I was working in retail I was assigned a section to work at but my managers did not notify me. An employee got sick and left so her shift was now mine, it seemed like my coworkers knew this and were mad at me. Despite this I covered my new section without pouting and I completed my job with no issues.\n",
      "A good parent listens to their child. They spend time with them. They don't criticize their child; they criticize the child's behavior. They teach their child by example.\n",
      "I used to be more reserved when it comes to political matters.  I was not particularly active or aware of the political climate and had this sense that reasonable people were in charge, knew how things were supposed to work, and acted accordingly for the greater good.  But the events of the last several years have taken place in front of us and in real-time (thanks to modern technology) and that has commanded much more of my attention and scrutiny.  I've migrated from a moderate position to a much more liberal one and make no apologies for my new awareness.  I believe every one of us has the right to be heard and considered, regardless of where we come from or our \"status\" in relation to everyone else and that right comes with great responsibility. My parents used to say \"treat others as you would want to be treated\".  I understood the concept but it was never as meaningful to me as it is now.\n",
      "I think my friend Jessamine is a very good parent. She's patient and kind and understands that her kids are people and they can't be perfect. She never says anything cruel and she supports their curiosity and really makes sure that they are well rounded. To me these are important traits.\n",
      "I would tell them about recent events in my life. I would talk about my life at school and mu typical day and about my family.\n",
      "I would share what I was feeling about an important issue in my life such world events that concerned me, my job, my pet, etc.\n",
      "There are several things that make someone a very good parent.  The most important is love.  Conveying a sense of love to your child is very important.  You need to make them feel safe, secure, and loved.  Patience is also needed to be a very good parent.  Children make many, many mistakes.  A patient parent that still loves their child even though they make mistakes is very important.\n",
      "Greetings, I am not the most extroverted person but if you do ever need my help in the office or want to grab lunch, I am surely down. Don't take my silence as ignorance or simply as off putting, it's just my energy and feel free to engage me if you'd like.\n",
      "All it takes to be a really good parent is to love and accept your child and to be as fully engaged in yourself and with them as you can be. Not that this is easy work, but it is completely worthwhile and rewarding, more than most anything else. It helps too to have a sense of who your child is, how they think, what they feel, how they learn, and how you can help them love and accept themselves. It helps to have a sense of humor and to be able to play as well as to work hard. It's important to rely on the emotional and practical support of others so that your child learns s/he doesn't have to do it all alone either. Most of all, love and fully accept your self. And don't worry—your child will be a wonderful teacher for you too. You'll be amazed.\n",
      "My friend Andrea is a good parent to her young daughter.  She is attentive, involved, patient, and loving. Possibly most importantly, she has worked on her own mental health for a long time and has a solid understanding of how she wants to raise her daughter to have mental wellness and be able to express and regulate emotions. She communicates intentionally to her daughter and seeks advice when she's unsure.\n",
      "I'd like you to know I'm a very shy and quiet person. I'm more of a listener than a talker so just because I don't have much to say, it doesn't mean I like you. I like taking in every detail of things you say and I really listen to it. A lot of people seem to think I'm mean because I don't go out of my way to make the first move or strike up a conversation. I just am shy and don't want to be shut down by someone. I want you to know even though I don't say much, I'm always there listening and will give you advise if you ask me and need me to.\n",
      "A difficult challenge I have faced in the workplace is acting happy while I'm not happy in order to please the customers.\n",
      "The most challenging situation I have encountered was when I recently hired someone into the HR department who had a bad history with one of my other employees who had been with the company for 5 years. The 2 ladies were not able to fully apply themselves to the job because of the tension they both felt from the presence of one other. Finally a vocal alteration took place in which I had to step between the 2 and stop the problem before it escalated into something physical. Although I was unnerved, it ended well, even though the newest employee was terminated for starting the incident.\n",
      "A difficult challenge I had in the workplace was to do my very first training class. It was challenging because I was nervous and worried that I would stumble over my words or say something wrong. I overcame it by remembering that this was not a big deal. You don't know these people and you have all your notes right next to you to look back on. Just take your time, breathe, and stay calm. I told myself to just be myself! I remembered back when I used to perform songs and thought if I can do that then I can teach a room full of adults how to use our EMR.\n",
      "I worked as an Intramural Sports Official for my University and had to overcome great anxiety in doing so. I was working some 4v4 flag football games and had to officiate a game that was fairly competitive and had some higher-up staff on one of the teams. This raised the stakes for me and made me nervous, and one of the players ended up doing a trick play that was a loophole to the rules since he knew a lot about Intramurals. He did this to sort of challenge us and I had to make a call in a split second, and ended up calling on it confidently as there's not much of an alternative. Although I was nervous, I couldn't let it get to me and keep my composure which got me through the situation just fine.\n",
      "In order to be a good parent, a parent must stop forgetting what it felt like to be a child.  They must remember how they were correct about things as a child, and how adults were wrong.   They must remember how it felt to be denied even though you were correct.  They must take that feeling and make sure never to apply it to their child.  They must listen to their child.  In order to hear exceptional things when listening to your child, you must cultivate an atmosphere conducive to such moments.  You must treat your child with respect.  You must save up for their future.  You must show them that they're a priority that is at the top of their list.  If you don't do these things, your child will eventually not be able to recognize you as they did when they were a child.  If that happens, you can kiss the years of growing with that child and thinking you knew them goodbye.\n",
      "I want to know similar interests. What music, tv or movies do they like? o they play video games? Try and find that common bond.\n",
      "My aunt had to raise us for most of my young childhood as my mom was a sing me mother and needed to work a lot to provide for me and my sister. On top of her three kids (my cousins) she cooked for us, bathed us, took us where we need to go wether it’s was school or extra curricular activities. She was a key part in helping my mom get the job that later on she would work for for over 20 years and become a manager of a team of numerous people.\n",
      "What makes a good parent is that you put the needs of your child before yourself. Your child will be your responsibility twenty four hours of the day.\n",
      "A good parent gives their child unconditional love. They teach their child honesty, empathy, and a love of God. They make sure their child has the life experiences and education that will help them become a well-rounded good person. It is a rewarding experience for a parent to see their child reach all of life's milestones successfully and happily.\n",
      "At my old job, I was tasked with a large corporate email overhaul project. This project involved both creating several hundred new email accounts and modifying the existing email accounts of our staff, all while ensuring no one lost any productivity due to these changes behind the scenes. This normally would be fairly straight forward but I was faced with several hurdles to overcome. For one, our staff were spread out across 16 different physical sites, so new email account credentials or modified credentials would need to be communicated across a physical barrier. Many staff also were not technically literate and had never been assigned a corporate email account before. It took a very decent amount of time, but eventually the project was completed.\n",
      "I had this dumb but funny drunk accident that is so goofy. It was my cousins birthday party and I decided to drink, well I ended up doing roughly around 7 shots and I got wasted. Apparently I was in the bathroom, possibly naked, and wouldn’t come out, I was told I was in there for almost an hour. And then when I went to go to sleep, I ended up sleeping on the top bunk bed and threw up on a hat and a ps4. You have any embarrassing drunk stories?\n",
      "I have loved Britney Spears since I was 10 years old. She is my idol and will continue to follow her until my death. She’s the reason for who I am. She thought me to be ok with my sexuality and just made my life that much easier. I’m a time where I was bullied for my sexuality she was my escape, she made it better. She will always be present in my life so anyone involved has to be ok with that\n",
      "I think you recently felt me seeming to pull away a bit in our friendship when I feel we could actually be very close friends. There's something about me that's helpful to know, and that is I need a lot of time alone. It somehow recharges my \"batteries\" and fills me with energy for my friendships. I should have let you know this sooner, as I know my behavior must have been kind of confusing, and I hope this helps to explain it. It's something I've always needed--even my parents commented on it as I was growing up--so it's just an ingrained part of me and not in any way a reaction to you. I love our friendship and look forward to its blossoming!\n",
      "A good parent is, above all, flexible. Your child will be a little bundle of chaos and unpredictability. A child is frustrating enough in and of itself, but if you have rigid expectations then a child will frustrate you endlessly.\n",

      "Honestly, the first person I thought of was Phillip Banks, from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, tv show. I beleive he was a great parent because he was always there for his kids, no matter what they got themselves into and however much is pained him. I beleive being a good parent means never giving up on your kid and genuinely rooting for their success. It's a parents job to teach their kid how to survive in the World.\n",

      "I was criticized by a customer, despite having done nothing wrong. They became angry with me, and I felt a pull to feel guilty accordingly. I checked in with colleagues to ensure that I had handled the situation appropriately. I spoke to my superiors to make sure that they heard my side of the story, so that they could balance this with feedback they received from the customer. In the end, the customer moved on, and the dust settled.\n",
      "In the summer before my senior year of high school, I interned as a curator and camp counselor at a local art museum. My boss was generally a difficult and demanding person to work for, but on one particular day, I learned a very important lesson from my experience with her. That day, I had to leave my internship fifteen minutes early for a doctor’s appointment, but I failed to let my boss know beforehand. When the time came for me to leave, I let my boss know that I was leaving for a doctor’s appointment. In response, she told me that we needed to have a serious talk. I was terrified; I thought I was going to get fired from my first internship. Instead of trying to defend myself, I realized that I needed to simply admit my mistake and apologize. When I came clean about my wrongdoing, my boss respected me more for being honest and humble about it. What I learned that day is that, sometimes, it is more important to make things right than to be right.\n",

      "I got hurt on the job and was unable to perform my work tasks adequately. I often depend on my job for social interaction and getting out of the house and keeping myself happy. When I got hurt, I was sent home and could not return to work for a long time. This became difficult for me to live my life normally as I was suffering from some social isolation and I also felt guilty not being able to help my coworkers. As a result of this, I worked very hard in my recovery and managed to get back to work earlier than expected and was able to make myself much happier and rejoin my coworkers and friends.\n",
      "I believe there are several factors that make a good parent. Listening is very important. Being caring and compassionate is also important. It is also important to remain open minded and easy going as things never work out as you expect.\n",

All of these people I have always treated fairly and truly care about them.\n",

      "When I started I thought standards were much lower then I discovered. Everything was a mess, so I thought the boss was laid back and not picky. No, he had just not been able to keep help at all so everything fell apart. He had extreme anxiety, micromanaged, over-worked and underpaid his people. All of his horses were either dangerous of had some other challenge. \n",
      "I set boundaries. I said NO a lot. I reminded hi that nobody else would show up twice and I did a good job. I did a good job taking care of his horses and showing him how to trust. By week 6 we had a good bond and could work as a team with him doing his job and me doing mine. \n",

      "My mother is the person who I think fits the role of a good and perfect parent. Throughout here time as a parent, she has constantly demonstrated compassions, sacrifice, loyalty, dedication and understanding towards her children and towards others. She did the role of a mother and a father while raising several children on her own and constantly providing for each of throughout the years. She showed what it meant to be selfless and nurturing towards others and this is why she fits the role of a good parent.\n",

My coworker and manager said they could mail her the letter.  It was very difficult at the time because she wanted to pay as soon as possible, but the letter took forever to get approved.  She called me back multiple times throughout three months.  Finally the letter go approved by our company's lawyer.  We mailed it out to her.  When she got it she paid it over the phone.  I was happy to get it resolved.  I knew if it wasn't myself and the customer putting pressure on the company, we could have never done it.\n",
      "A good parent must let a child think on his own. Be careful not to smother the kid with too much attention. Let the kid face adversity by himself from time-to-time. It;s the only way he can develop the skills to thrive in this world.\n",

      "The best example of a good parent would be both my mom and dad, but more precisely my dad. He was my hero. He was there when I first got on a school bus. He was always there to help me with my homework (he was a genius at math. I guess that’s where I get my love of math from). He taught me how to play baseball and football, and he was my coach. He was there when I got my first job as a deckhand on a deep sea fishing boat, and he helped me buy my first car. He encouraged me to enlist in the Navy, and it was one of the best decisions of my life. He watched me grow up and become a man and a father, and he always told me how proud he was of me. My best advice would be to get involved with your children at a very young age and keep a close relationship. It will pay off big time when your kids are grown. Then you’ll get to look back and marvel at the wonderful son or daughter you have raised.\n",
      "The number one thing that makes a good parent is knowing when to protect and when to allow the child to experiment and perhaps fail.  The tendency nowadays is to be a \"helicopter\" parent, always hovering over the child to completely protect and avoid any negative consequences.  I think this does not allow the child to grow and develop naturally.  Trying and failing is an important part of growing up.\n",
      "My workplace is very fast paced and getting my performance on the same level as my coworkers was difficult. The early days were very rough on me and left me exhausted trying match others. There were other recruits but they would only hire a handful so my work couldn't just be good it had to be better. I eventually prevailed.\n",
      "While I know that relationships that start out online might proceed a little more slowly in the interest of safety and comfort, I just want you to know that you can tell me anything at all, as I am here to listen, empethize with you, and understand where you are coming from.\n",

      "When I first started, I had a difficult teammate. She didn't want to train and talked bad about everything. I got through it by going to my boss. He has the team do team building exercises. In the end it worked and we became a good team. I think the team building helped a lot.\n",
      "Because we have a common interest in the type of employment we do, I would like to engage further in a discussion about wage remuneration.  As I am a student of political economy, I believe it would be a worthwhile conversation, in that it may very well lead to a greater return on our collective labor time.  Analyzing different angles, perspectives in our business approach will benefit both of us.\n",
      "Attention and enthusiasm are the most important traits to being a good parent. Paying attention to your child's needs - not just their expressed ones, but their unexpressed ones - will enable you to respond and communicate better. And interacting with enthusiasm will show that you care about what they do and say, and encourage them to do it more.\n",
      "I think of my Father when it comes to being a good parent. My Father was a single father to my sister and I . He always made sure that we had the things we needed for school and basic living. Money was alwasy tight so we did not get to do a lot of expensive stuff often but he still made sure we got to do things like going to the park or other stuff that was inexpensive or free. I know it could not be easy raising two children alone and thats why I look up to him.\n",
      "I would like to give you my ideal of a perfect parent. I was lucky enough to have been brought up by her. My mother had great patience having been one of nine children. the brought me up the way she was brought up.  She was a strict but loving person and taught me to be a kind and loving person also.  She taught me to ask questions and be adventurous.  She taught me to love learning and to love reading.  So my answer to what makes a great parent is to look at my mother.  She made me who I am today.\n",

      "\n",
      "Seems like we’ve lost touch over the years and I’d love to reconnect if you are up for it.  My son just got married and my daughter is getting married later this year.  It made me think about when we each at each other’s weddings and how close we were then.\n",
      "The biggest thing in my opinion in unconditional love. Being involved in your child life and letting them know that they always have someone to talk to no matter the situation. Discipline is also important, you have to prepare them for the real world because you will not be here at some point to care and help them.\n",
      "Well it would depend on how I know the person, are they a coworker or neighbor, maybe just someone you see daily, it also depends on what we are doing at the moment\n",
      "Being loving and present. No work call or emails during time together. The. Just love the shit out of them.\n",
      "I struggle with trusting people as a result of my childhood trauma as well as trauma endured during my time in the military. I came from a broken family and suffered abuse at the hands of a step-parent. As you can imagine this made things tough mentally coupled with the experiences of going to war and witnessing and doing things no person should have to experience. As a result of all this I have suffered from PTSD for years which explains certain odd behaviors as well as my reluctance to become close with people.\n",

      "We had a relatively large change up in our administration at the job I work at. I am part of that administrative team. I was very close to a few of the members of the administrative team that left for other companies or retired. It was a very big adjustment because I was very used to the team dynamic previously and had a very good working relationship. It’s a work in progress with the current team.\n",
      "Hey, I'd like to share something with you that is very important to me. I know you like nature and I wanna share how much I've always liked to be out in nature and during the past 15-20 years, how much I like to grow my own food, to practice permaculture and learn about the plants and the ecosystem.\n",
      "Someone who take the time to care and think about you as well as themselves.  You have to be willing to miss work. You have to be willing to give up your time.  In short a good parent is someone who is always there.\n",
      "Hi, Its nice to get to know you. I am really into video games, and lately into the new Madden game. Its how I spend my free time relaxing. Often people want to hang out with me, and try to go out. But lately I havent been really feeling it, so ive been keeping to myself. The way I spend my time is really important to me, and I value the freedom I get when I dont have any responsibilities.\n",
      "I had to take on a new role at work when a coworker unexpectedly quit. I was unfamiliar with how he does his job and my employer expected me to pick it up quickly and keep things operating smoothly. I wasn't given a lot of time to learn everything and the stakes were high. I was able to learn what I needed and rise to the occasion.\n",
      "Hey X, we've been hanging out a lot recently and I wanted to let you know that the reason I'm always leaving early is because I'm a recovered alcoholic. I don't like to tell a lot of people about it, because its pretty sensitive, and I don't want to draw too much attention to myself. But yeah, its not just that I don't drink, its that I have to be careful around alcohol still. So, I just wanted you to know, since we're friends and all. I didn't want you to think I might be acting strangely.\n",
      "It was when I was working with my dad and he does construction. The whole day I had to lift heavy objects as well as constantly be on the move so that alone was a challenge since it was very physically demanding. However, I overcame it by having the mindset that I can do this job and I can do it well, so basically I kept telling myself do not let your dad down and most importantly do not let yourself down. So with that motivation I finished the job.\n",
      "Years ago I got a job at a restaurant and found myself a bit of a cultural outsider - the majority of the people working in the kitchen were Hispanic and spanish-speaking, many of them from Mexico or South America.  While I've always gotten along with people in general, they were a very closed/tight-knit group and they were a bit reluctant to my presence, being an outsider of sorts.  I made an concerted effort to get to know them and make sure I was seen as an asset, offering to help in little ways as each shift went on.  I finally made ground with one guy, Jose, and he and I started talking more and I suggest we start doing a weekly thing where a couple of us make meals for everyone before our shift got busy on Tuesday nights (the slowest night of the week for that restaurant.)  It was a big success and got me accepted by the others on the team.\n",
      "My first day of my latest position was definitely a very difficult experience. I took over an elementary special education class and adjusting to a new building, new routine, new coworkers, and new students. I made it through the day by just focusing on one detail at a time while breaking the difficulty of the first day into smaller easily addressed steps.\n",
      "Hello I've been giving it some thought lately And I would like to Take our friendship and relationship to another level. meaning I would like to get closer with you on an emotional level . However there are some things about me that you will learn that you might not like . For instance, I have HIV and I have been positive for several years But I am undetectable and cannot transmit the disease Even with unprotected sex. I have some things on my background like theft and DUI that are hindering me from getting a job Right now that I would like And I have to settle for a very meager forms of income But I feel that friendships in relationships Should have nothing to do with social class or income level. Hopefully you will agree with me and Maybe we can Go out to dinner or have a couple drinks and talk more about this in person.\n",
      "so what is a good parent? someone who can love hard and not just worry about theur own needs,  they will support their child in everything that the child does and wantv their child to have a better life than they did. i know too many mothers who are jelous of their kids for being smarter or more beautiful or more talented. they need to give their child unlimited love and npt hold love over their kids head making the child do anything for that mother or father love. they eill want their kids to have a better and easier life ,  they need to talk tho their child always and keep in touch with how their kids life is going. they need to put their child first and their own needs last. and for sure you dont want your kid to grow up into a bad adult. you want them to be the best adult ever and be willing to do anything to help that along.\n",
      "Raising a child is difficult, but even more rewarding.  They are an extension of you and a sponge for knowledge.  It's important to always try to keep them engaged in something, or many things.  Their minds are fresh and are craving new experiences.  Get ready for questions.  A younger child loves to ask questions.  This helps them to organize and better understand what they are experiencing.  Have patience and set aside time to answer the questions they ask you, regardless of how silly they may seem at times.  Think ahead, and try to have many things for the child to use, and activities for the child to get involved with.  Remind the child how much they mean to you and share your emotions with your child.\n",
      "Hey, I want to get to know you better, but figure it's only fair that you know a bit more about me. I'm usually reserved, but passionate about politics, current events, and history. I have a small circle of friends that I'm loyal to, and I enjoy spending time with them.\n",
      "Months into the pandemic the Executive Director at my place of employment was not requiring employees to wear masks at work. We receive many visitors from the public during the day, and I was concerned that we were not keeping ourselves and our visitors safe. I had a difficult conversation with my supervisor, expressed my concerns, and indicated that I felt strongly that we should all be required to mask at work. Eventually, the policy changed and employees have been masking ever since.\n",
      "I would like to talk to you about my religious upbringing. I was raised in a very conservative, religious home, which strongly affected many aspects of who I am today. Because of how religion was forced upon me, I am now very opposed to religious ties. I feel negatively about the church and structured religion. I find it hypocritical and strive instead for spirituality outside of traditional religion.\n",
      "Someone who listens with intent to understand. Always looking at the situation from the other person/child's point of view and trying to understand their emotions, even if you believe they may have done something wrong. Having an open mind and connecting with your child over their passions.\n",
      "My parents are good parents because, as was appropriate based on our age, they gave us opportunities to grow in independence, which have made our transitions to adulthood easy. They also modeled good character, and made our house a place where we could disclose things to them without fear of judgment. This has served us well, and I think will serve you well as you become a parent\n",
      "trauma bonding (talking about traumas and if we have similar ones), and interests (if they like any tv shows, games, youtubers, if they use tik tok, do cosplaying, etc)\n",
      "I served in the military for 20 years. Some of the biggest obstacles where working with people from all walks of life. Getting people prepared for Air Assault school was always a challenge. You have to come up with a plan and what motivates people to complete the final road march and obstacle course. I would create a fitness plan to reach these goals\n",
      "The difficult challenge I faced in the workplace was having hours taking away when I had more tasks to do. This was difficult because I felt like I needed more time to do assign tasks, but I had a tighter constraint. I overcame this by re-working my schedule to fit the assignments I had.\n",
      "It was very challenging for me to start a new job at a different company from where I'd worked for the prior 12 years. I had to understand the new ways of doing things, get to know so many new people, and integrate myself into a new company culture. I threw myself into this challenge and spent as much time as I could getting to know people in the organization, taking any training offered to me, and spending a lot of time hands on doing the work, without fear of failing. I had to realize that it was okay to make mistakes at the beginning and that is the best way to learn sometimes.\n",
      "My mother always gave me great advice. She always told me I can do anything I dream of as long as I'm willing to put the work into it. She guided me throughout my life. Always made sure I knew that she was there to listen to any of my problems. My mom made me feel as if not matter what happened I would have her to catch me. She was a very attentive parent and made sure our voices were heard.\n",
      "Difficult challenge I have had in the workplace is setting boundaries. When you are young in an environment with people who have years of experience your boundaries tend to become zero and people think they can walk all over you. I have learned to remain calm and always tell people if I can or cannot help them out. You always want to remain respected in your work environment and seem like a team player.\n",
      "A difficult challenge I experienced in the workplace was having to use the programming tool, R, on a project for the first time. This was difficult because I needed to complete my project in a timely manner, yet I was quite new to the tool. I had to learn how to use the tool as I went through the project, which was quite stressful.\n",
      "a good parent is someone who cares but doesnt control. More who understands and teaches than wants to dominate and control\n",
      "A very good parent takes time for their children. This parent listens to their child about their day. They take time to teach the child basic skills while being patient. They don’t react with anger when the child acts out. They show compassion and unconditional love so the child feels accepted and supported.\n",
      "I think what makes a good parent is how they handle their children when they do something wrong/get into trouble, and how they express their negative emotions. A parent of a good friend of mine, instead of blindly yelling at her, sits her down and talks to her daughter about her actions and their consequences. As a result, my good friend grew up very well behaved and she thinks through her actions. Additionally, the parent does not take out negative emotions on her children, which doesn't make my friend hyper-sensitive to others' moods.\n",
      "Hello!\n",
      "Sorry if this seems a bit odd to write about, but I thought this is something you should know. I'm very much a people pleaser, and often struggle with making decisions. Because of this, I may ask you to decide more things. I'm working on getting better with this, but it is something I struggle with. I don't want to put pressure on you to make more decisions, but just know that I may not be the most helpful in that process. I hope you understand, and I'm sorry if this hurts our relationship.\n",
      "If I wanted to get closer to an acquaintance of mine, I would share my thoughts about concepts that are important to me. I value family, loyalty, trustworthiness, and kindness above many other attributes, and I would hope that my acquaintance shares some of those values. I might open up more about my past and personal life as well.\n",

      "A difficult challenge I experienced in the workplace was trying to work very fast during busy times, but also needing to take a break for water, but not knowing how to tell my boss that I needed a break during the busiest time.\n",
      "I think the best parenting style is a authoritative parent. These are parents that will instill important lesions in their child, but in a manner that is collaborative. Kids learn so much from their parents, and the way you interact and teach your child will define their future behaviors/life. Multiple times a week my dad would casually talk to me about how lucky we are to be alive, and how I need to take advantage of this opportunity, and now my baseline happiness is so high because he instilled this into me as a kid. Your works and actions are so impactful on your child, so give them a solid foundation, to let them grow into the world.\n",
      "I think striking the right balance between discipline and flexibility makes someone a good parent.  Kids need to have limits and rules but they shouldn't have to be like little soldiers.\n",
      "Someone who is kind, patient, an active listener where the child can explain an issue to you and you will be able to ingest the information and provide a collected response. Someone who lifts you up and has confidence in your abilities, but helps you understand fairness of situations and can be honest with feedback. Overall, someone who loves their child unconditionally and provides the best life for them that they can.\n",
      "A worker came into my office without knocking, which triggered my PTSD. I yelled at him and used very unprofessional language.  While the worker never received a reprimand, I did, and it felt like I was being punished unfairly for a breach in privacy and protocol from another person. There wasn't a good resolution, and I was looking for new jobs when my boss (who had reprimanded me) was replaced. The old boss didn't take a stalking incident seriously, either. Fortunately, my new boss did take it seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, if I were in an interview, and it came up, I would explain that a worker entered my office without knocking, catching me off-guard. I would admit my fault in the issue, but I would not mention the PTSD or the other issues I had with my boss. Bringing up issues of sexism and double-standards rarely goes well, even in an enlightened environment.\n",
      "I am a graduate student, so my workplace is my lab that I belong to. One difficult work-related experience was when I first joined graduate school and received copious comments on my first paper draft. I interpreted the feedback as negative. This experience was challenging because, prior to graduate school, I had typically received really positive feedback on my writing (and, more generally, academic work broadly). This experience made me feel as if I was not \"cut out\" to be a researcher. I overcame this hurdle by learning to re-frame feedback: instead of interpreting it as a criticism, I began to think of feedback as an opportunity for growth, development, and learning. I am still working on developing this skill, but I have made a lot of progress over the years.\n",
      "Lately I've been very disappointed about my job. I get it why you left it. I don't feel I am being appreciated here. I worked really hard and achieved great results but did not receive the salary raise for two years in a row despite that.\n",
      "Being present when you can be for your child. I know it can be hard if you work or go to school, but when your child is around be present with them. Play games with them, teach them new things, even just making sure you are acknowledging them. Try your best to live in the moment with your child and not live through your phone with them.\n",
      "My job was documentation manager at a large university hospital. I had been put in the department that dealt with accreditation. This included being put under the supervision of the manager of that department, who was charged with doing about three full-time job. She decided I would begin doing data collection and analysis. Math is my blind spot and I have no experience with that sort of thing. I tried to explain this to her, but she refused to listen. My regular work was piled up (I'd been hired after the job had been vacant for over a year) so I didn't really have time for her work, too. So I refused as best I could, which she said was insubordination. I ended up having to file a grievance with HR.\n",
      "At the time, my workplace brought on too many new employees at once. There were not enough established employees or managers to help train them. One night, it was just 2 new employees working the cash registers. There was a rush of customers. We were overwhelmed.\n",
      "While I was in training for anew position, a personal matter in my life caused me to miss some days of my initial training. This could have been very bad and resulted in losing my job but I explained the situation honestly to my supervisor and made up what I had missed\n",
      "To me,a good parent is one that is first and foremost involved in every aspect of their child's life. But...not overbearing. A good parent must also teach their child to be independent and self-reliant. A good parent doesn't tell their child to go do their homework...a good parent is interested in their child's homework and there to help and talk about it.\n",
      "A good parent always has their meals with their child.A good parent is patient,sympathetic,and flexible. It's okay for a parent to change their minds.!\n",

      "this morning I started my day with some eggs for breakfast, then I headed straight to my daily chores. I am a pretty clean person and I like to clean daily, even if its just dishes and vacuuming my carpet floors in my room. After I cleared the sink, threw out the garbage, and brushed my teeth, I took my dog for a walk. He is 8 years old and he is a pitbull- my favorite breed of dog. Once were back, I fed my three cats, my snake, and my gecko. I do have a lot of animals, but I enjoy caring for them and I hope to someday become a reputable reptile breeder. My other pets I have for companionship and I would love to have another dog once I live in a house.\n",
      "i think what makes a good parent is not judging your kids. you should listen to them and accept them and their decisions. in times that you think those decisions are wrong you should explain why and not make override their wants.\n",
      "It is so easy to get bogged down in all that you have to do as a parent. The to do list is never ending and the stress can seem insurmountable at times. What is most helpful in parenting is keeping things light even in times of stress. Kids respond better to calm parents because they are learning how to regulate their emotions. This will help you as a parent to also stay in the moment more.\n",
      "Hey, I wanted to apologize if I came across as distant or aloof the other day when we hung out.  I wanted to open up to you about something that my family and I have been going through recently.  My daughter has struggled with mental health issues in the past and is currently struggling again.  I really value your friendship and support, and just wanted to let you know that this is something I am dealing with.  If you have any questions or insight, I am open to talk about it anytime.\n",
      "I've been trying to work on how I see myself and analyzing my emotions. For a year, I was meditating a year straight and I was the happiest I've ever been. But then COVID happened and I started having dreams where I would vividly dream a celebrity getting killed and it would happen the next day. So I had to stop. But that brought my mental health down a lot.\n",
      "I would tell them about the things in my life that give me the most joy. I feel most alive and fulfilled when I'm outside exploring my home state and taking photos of the things that I see.\n",
      "When it gets busy and people are not communicating well it makes the flow of the job harder. I decided to step up and coordinate where people should go in order to make things flow better.\n",
      "I'd tell them about where and how I grew up. Some of my experiences through college and during my earlier life. I'd tell them thing like I'm an only child. That I grew up in a fairly rural area and spent my days exploring the woodlands around me. Id tell them about my college experience and that I have a degree in psychology but that art has always been my first love. I'd talk about my two daughters and two grandsons. About how each is doing and what they are like. I'd tell them a little about my husband and our relationship and how we met as that is a good story.\n",
      "I discovered later in life that I love to walk. I moved into this big city and discovered having a car (which I thought I would die without!) was a royal pain. Garage parking was too expensive and alternate side of the street regulations requiring that cars be moved on certain days cost me a small fortune in tickets. I had access to subways and busses, but I realized that I could walk to many place and built up to 10,000 steps a day. I loved the peace it brought to me ... I loved seeing different people ... looking in store windows ... learning new things every day. I am a walker and would love to have a friend to walk with.\n",
      "Hey there, I heard about your sad experience. Just wanted you to know that I'm here for you need a supportive ear. Thought you might also appreciate not having to cook for a day, but might also not feel ready for company so I ordered your favorite meal from a local restaurant to be delivered whenever you like. Info to set delivery time is below. I'll reach out to you from time to time and when you're ready to talk or for some company, just let me know. Wanted you to know that I'm thinking of you and I know that you'll get through this.\n",
      "It was challenging for me to enter my workplace with less knowledge than my coworkers. Not immediately having all the information that they had made me feel as if I was falling behind before I even started. I struggled to catch up and learn as much as I could about every process at work. With a lot of care and attention, I feel as though I learned enough to be on par with my coworkers, and even more knowledgable in some cases.\n",
      "A challenge I️ experience in the work place is actively staying engaged in a meeting. Though meetings are beneficial for communication and staying on the same page as a group, it is hard to remain focused when there is so much to get done. If the meeting is very inefficient, I️ zone out and between to focus on the other tasks I️ need to get done for the day.\n",
      "Hi friend!\n",
      "I wanted to share a little bit about what got me into the field I'm in today. As you know, I want to be a doctor. But I didn't always know this. Growing up, I knew I had an interest in science and math and I loved helping others, but I didn't know where to take that interest. Then, during my sophomore year of high school, my father was diagnosed with brain cancer. I watched him quit his job and go through months of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. I slowly realized that I had such an interest in the science behind his treatment and the mysteries of the human body. I also realized that a lot of his recovery was in part due to the compassion and bedside manner that his doctors gave him. This experience inspired me to help future patients in the same way that my father's doctors helped him.\n",

      "I hope that it is alright that I tell you a little more about me, since we've become friends. You might have already noticed how awkward I am in certain situations with people. I really don't know how to act normal.  This might have been due to the neglect I experienced as a baby before I was adopted.\n",

      "To be a good parent is to be patient and kind. To teach them as many helpful skills as possible and to read to them. Limit technology and let their imaginations flow. Use a sense of humor when things get tough and your patience is running out with them, in other words, don't take everything so seriously. Let them make mistakes and be there for guidance but don't help them with everything, let them be independent and figure things out. Listen to their emotions and offer support or advice. Let them express themselves how they please and never judge their looks or interests. Be their friend but give them structure and punishment when necessary. Find a good balance.\n",
      "A difficult challenge I faced was gender discrimination. My manager, a male, only allowed our one other male associate to take days off, leave early, etc. He made an exception for the other male, but not us females. This was challenging because I didn't know what to do about the situation.\n",
      "I had an employee post an F U on their twitter about me.  Not only that but another manager was the one that told this person something I had said about this employee to make them mad.  Nothing was said that was mean or nasty about the employee.  It was when I was filling out the info for their evaluation.  I said they needed improvement in one area.  This manager had no right to say anything at all. Now things are awkward and I can't trust anyone at work.\n",
      "My mother is a great parent. She works so hard to financially provide for me, and still works to set up my future financially. Besides being financially sound, she has always been a confidant to talk to, and listens before judging.\n",
      "I would share just common things I do and how I live my day to day life. I would just be casual when talking to them because I would just be talking about casual day to day things. I might share some about my relationships with family members and other things like that as well.\n",
      "I think a good parent just tries their best to do what they should for their child and to make their child continue to grow mentally, emotionally, and physically. A good parent makes sure their child is fed, bathed, and gets attention properly. A good parent also makes sure their child is safe and gets punished when needed. As long as their child is happy and healthy, I believe the parent is doing everything right. They may not be happy all the time, like if they're in trouble or something, but in general, they will be happy.\n",
      "I would say that that my interests are helping others solve their technology problems, folk music and festivals, and watching birds/hiking/enjoying nature.\n",
      "One of the more difficult challenges I had at work was in a job where obtaining help was very difficult.  There were certain instructions with my job to contact someone in a position above me if certain things occurred.  Typically when these things did happen during my shift I had a hard time finding anyone to call on.  It made me learn work arounds for dealing with these particular issues and also made me appreciate helping others on my own when I could.\n",
      "I think what makes a good parent is a combination of trust and patience. My parents have always told me that they will trust me until they can't anymore. I have never given them a reason to not trust me because they always told me that they would rather know what i'm doing than for me to sneak around and keep secrets from them. I also think patience is a very important trait to have as a parent as well.\n",
      "A good parent spends time with their child and is engaged in their life. They take pictures of the family and do family things together. They make sacrifices, put their own needs aside, and focus not on themselves- but on their kid. A good parent has a structure and schedule. They keep the kids active and talk to them ab out everything. They explain life, politics, history, and show them they are a equal part of the world. They command respect by respecting their child. They get love from their child by loving wholeheartedly, and accepting the child for who they are, not what they want the child to be.\n",
      "Hi! I wanted to tell you some things about myself. I love listening to music and true crime podcast. I also love to go to try places in my area. I also love reading books.\n",
      "One challenge that I can think of is that I was asked to create a table from about 20 interviews and extract information from them. It was difficult to do as some of the interviews didn't explicitly state some of the information that we were attempting to extract. Also, some interviews where from the same group but different people. Thus, making note of that was difficult as they weren't in order.\n",
      "I think telling you about my favorite recent dream will tell you just about everything you need to know about me? So I was living in a house that had a big room like the loading space in The Matrix, and it would populate with racks and racks of clothes depending on who came into the room, and it would change if you went in with different combinations of people. But in that room there was also a smaller, cube-like room, the interior walls of which were composed of Scooby-Doo's mother. Yes, Grendel's Mother-style. A guy was visiting, and every day he was able to take exactly one piece of Scooby's mom's pelt to try to make a coat out of it, but he kept failing to get a piece that would work. And I said to him, \"Dude, just try coming into the room with different people, and stop trying to get a jacket out of the primordial Doo.\"\n",
      "I was training someone at work that was struggling a bit in keeping up with the pace of the work environment. I admittedly did become frustrated at first because it is an important job and falling behind does not only have consequences for myself, but also for providers and patients. I took a step back for a minute and reminded myself that I want to provide this person with the best training possible so that they may be successful in our company. I adjusted some of my methods of training and tried to match their style of learning as best as I could. I had to change my attitude to make our training shift valuable, as well as meet the demands of the job.\n",
      "I think my dad is a good parent. He balances good authority with realisiticness. He knows that in high school/college kids tend to grow and do things their parents might not like. He understands these things and approaches them fairly and understandably. Mainly I think my dad still remembers and understands what it was like to grow up, and he parents in a way that makes that the best as possible, while still being a parent.\n",
      "To me, being a good parent means doing your best to care for your child and help them navigate this crazy world we are living in while respecting their dignity and worth! They are worth taking time to spend with them, and you need to give them space to grow into the person they are meant to be without the pressures of society or from you.\n",
      "A difficult task I overcame in my previous workplace was racist coworkers. They were openly Trump supporters and during this time was the peak of BLM protests. They made it clear they did not support the movement and would then talk down on other minorities. I myself am hispanic and hearing this was difficult. I told myself the more I ignore it the less I'd be tempted to say something. Eventually after some time I did end up quitting but I realized that the method I used to overcome that environment was to not react. Reacting would've given them the satisfaction they so desperately needed and I hold myself to a higher standard than they do to themselves.\n",
      "Hi! I feel very strongly about mental health too.  I actually have social anxiety that affects how I do and feel in social situations. I just wanted to let you know so you knew more about me and if you ever wondered why I was quiet sometimes.\n",
      "There was a time where I was alone working and it was a big warehouse. I had a error on my RF gun that I had no clue what it was; I was still in training and no one was around to help. I went through the menu and it took a few minutes and somehow I was able to figure out what to do correctly sort of by guesswork. It was challenging because it was my first week there so I was still clueless with quite a lot there.\n",
      "Hi. My names Kaylon. I live outside of the Charlotte area and I am a counselor at an elementary school. I love working with kids and it honestly doesn't feel like a job to me because I love it so much.\n",
      "A really good parent is someone who treats their child like they are their own person, not merely an extension of themselves. They do not force interests or desired personality traits upon their child, but rather let the child explore their own interests and lets them feel out their own emotions and desires. They do not merely let their child do whatever they want; rather, they let the child express themselves and their emotions, and help them learn to regulate and manage feelings and desires. The goal is to raise a child who knows how to respond well to various emotions and challenges, and who is secure in knowing that their parents value them as an individual with different feelings and desires, and encourages them to be the best version of their own self. They do not lash out at the child, or respond with passive aggression. They do not take tantrums or other strong emotions personally, but rather help the child acknowledge work through those feelings. They let their child shine in their own hobbies and interests, and don't attempt to make the child's accomplishments about them. In short, they make sure their child knows they are loved and secure no matter what, and any discipline or guidance is done in order to help the child grow up as a secure, confident adult that can manage their own emotions.\n",
      "I had a job I really liked, with a supervisor I really did not like. He had obvious favorites. Each morning, we each reported to him to find out our assignment for that day.

      "The second the relationship ended, he started giving me really hard, very strenuous assignments. It was a very trying time, and unfortunately led to me leaving the company.\n",
      "I think what makes a good parent is being patient and understanding. A good parent should be accepting of their child and who they are and help guide them without judgement or aggression. They respect their kid's boundaries and will provide emotional support throughout the stages of their life.\n",
      "They're understanding and not overly harsh or lax. They're willing to listen and be rational in decisions, not fueled by emotion. They're uplifting and encouraging and do allow for freedom and growth.\n",

It took me a long time to figure out that I needed temporary medication to get back into a good sleep pattern, and also counseling to talk through some things.  Once I figured out those two thing, I was able to get well pretty quickly.  You are such a great teacher, and we are here to support you.  Please let me know if there is anything you need, and know we have all been through similar things in the past.  Call or text if you feel you'd like to talk with me, or if you have any questions about the med I took. \n",

      "Patience and love. That's what makes a good parent. As a grandmother of an autistic grandchild I watch my daughter struggle with raising her son. He's almost three and non communicative. She tries to teach him sign language, but he's not responsive. Yet, she pays close attention to him to determine his needs and if/when he throws a fit because he can't speak, she speaks calmly to him and helps him through his tantrums. He's an amazing child and it's obvious that he's loved.\n",
      "A good parent is one that will drop everything and help their children if they need it. No matter what's going on in the parent's life, the welfare of their child should always be first. It is important for a parent to be responsive and protect and assist the child because they rely so heavily on them for the first parts of their life.\n",
      "For a stretch of time I worked with a very difficult coworker. He would often not complete his work, and would often blame others for mistakes that were made by him. I had to navigate working with him for about two years. He would often try to \"throw me under the bus\" so to speak. I figured out a way to deal with working with him diplomatically, and I never stooped to his level. If I got reprimanded for something that was actually his fault, I just took it on the chin and moved on. He was let go eventually, and the work atmosphere became better.\n",

      "At the end of the day, I think that it is best to be honest about your capabilities and skills.\n",
      "It is not an easy task, there is not really a perfect book that teaches you how to be a good parent because every child is different, but I think the most important thing is communication, let them know that despite everything you are for them, is not to become their friend because if you do you stop being their parent and lose that position of respect and authority, it is very important that they have someone to guide them and take the difficult decisions while growing give them the best example possible although you know it will never be perfect and above all give them love, time and enjoy every moment with them.\n",

      "Something that makes someone a good parent is being kind and happy.  I know I yell at my kids way too much, and I am trying to calm down with it.  I feel there are so many factors out of my control.  I think having a loving, caring marriage affects so much in the house and my marriage is a joke.  My husband literally does not care about any of us.  He wants to work and then do his own thing, he comes home drunk or high and it's intolerable.  I think trust is a huge thing.  I had a friend who grew up in an amazing household.  Her parents did things with them, there was so much love there.  They did chores but the mom also stayed home and did a lot for them.  They were all supportive of each other.  I didn't have anything like that at home and i see my household now falling apart to what mine was growing up.l\n",

      "I had an employee who was always reliable and a very hard worker. All of a sudden she wasn't showing up for shifts and she was just not getting her work done like she had once done. She also seemed tired and depressed. My first instinct was to let her go. I thought she had just become bored with the job. I decided to take a different approach and I asked her what was going on. Normally, I wouldn't pry into someone else's personal business, but she had been such an exemplary employee I decided to pry. I found out there was a serious illness in her family that she had been very upset by and had to help a lot more at home, so her thoughts were very scattered. I was able to work around her schedule and she was better able to balance home and work. In the end she became the valuable employee she had been.\n",
      "I had finally gotten a job with a major company I'd admired for a long time. One thing I hadn't expected was that I'd have to give frequent presentations; it hadn't even been mentioned to me in training. When I was told that I could not hold my job without making these presentations to the public, I was really nervous--so nervous I'd thought of quitting right on the spot. I was worried and talked that evening to a friend who had a lot of public speaking experience and they helped guide me through it and not focus on how I felt I was coming across and just to relax as if I was explaining something to a friend. It took many tries, and I'm sure my first few weeks were awful to sit through and it was indeed scary, but I got past it and no longer feared presentations as much. Now, I'm at ease with speaking in public and do so regularly.\n",

      "I think the number one thing about parenting is to show your child unconditional love and give them time. Kids want to spend time with you. Set good examples because they watch us. Be careful what you do and what you say in front of them. Expose them to all the good things in life. Teach them the best you can. Always remember no one is perfect and you will make mistakes and that is okay!\n",
      "Unfortunately, I don't think I can really say too much about this topic, I've been a student all my life, and because my parents are kind enough to support my academic endeavors, I have yet to have to enter the workplace. But I have had sometimes had issues when doing some of the long-term volunteer work in high school, which is the closest thing I have had to actually work. I was volunteering at a summer camp that a club at my high school ran, and I decided I wanted to help as one of the day camp conciulers. Because I joined last more last minute, I didn't have the training or experience in it. So I never really knew what to except each day, have had to help with many of the day's acidemic lessons more on the fly, as I didn't have a lot of time to prep for each day, and I could be hectic trying to talk to parents and watch the kids in my group. Eventually I started to figure things out by the end of the week, but It was pretty stressful at the begining.\n",
      "I love to have conversations with my parents about what i was like when i was younger and all of the funny things I did. Did you do any of these same things? I liked for them to tell me stories about the past and what the world was like for them growing up.\n",

People always love to see photos and videos of my pets then we start getting into vet talk and experiences and how quirky our animals are then everyday after when we see eachother we talk about our pets.\n",
      "When I was working in Special Education with 18 to 22 year olds, there were difficult challenges constantly. One of the alarming ones was that the staff was not given the proper equipment to safely transfer students into and out of their wheelchairs. These students were adults and the size of grown adults, and it was physically unsafe for them as well as staff, with a high chance of injury.  I was very persistent and vocal about this problem, and eventually our union got involved. That was NOT my preferred outcome, but it did accomplish the goal, in that we were provided with mechanical lifts and allowed to use two staff do do the transfers.\n",
      "I grew up with an emotionally and verbally abusive Mother. It got so bad that at 17 I left home and never came back. I have not spoken to her since and she does not attempt to reach out to me. It used to hurt, but since having kids of my own I have made peace with that part of my life and have chosen to never treat my own children that way. No one deserves that, but it made me a stronger and better person in the long run.\n",

      "I had a coworker who did not respect her fellow coworkers.  She would constantly belittle other coworkers, refuse to listen to those who where above her but were not the manager, and would do things like record her coworkers private messages without consent.  In this case, as I was the evening supervisor but not the manager, once I was informed of these issues, I let the manager know.\n",
      "I think there are a lot of things that make someone a good parent. Number one and most important would be always trying your best. As long as you can say with 100% certainty that you are trying your best, then you are doing a good job. I think being supportive is a crucial quality to a good parent. Be supportive of what your kids want to do. You can give advice, but regardless of their choice, make sure they know that you love. Communication is key as well. Your child should know that they can come to talk to you about anything and that you will always love them and be there for them.\n",
      "A good parent provides their children a strong support system. They are their for them when they are feeling down. They give life advice to their children because they have a lot more experiences. They listen and teach their children life values so they grow up to be good people.\n",
      "I can't really write about other people's parenting styles, as I don't know what goes on behind closed doors. So I will write about my own parents, whom I think did a great job.   They were quite hands off.  We we were raised to be independent, and they felt their job was so guide us  There were boundaries, and there were actions and reactions.  We were encouraged to read wide and broadly, and controversial ideas were discussed (in a watered down way), to show there is often more than one answer and or solution.  We were often allowed to sit in on adult conversations (mostly about politics), but we weren't encouraged to contribute to the conversation.  We had to retire at 9pm every night;  not necessarily to sleep, but to give our parents time to be together without having us around.\n",
      "Before I retired from work in 2016, I wanted to find somewhere to volunteer to help people in my community. My husband had died three years before, and my children had their own lives. I met an Hispanic couple who were wanting to tutor Hispanic children and teach ESL and GED classes to the parents. I helped organize the organization, and it became a non-profit. It has been wonderful watching the children we tutor excel in school. I am so proud of all of them and of the work we have done for the immigrants in our community.\n",
      "My boss had me start a big project that would support another department.  I worked on it for several weeks.  My boss always wanted to get her way.  In a meeting with the head of the department I was working g on the project for, he stated they were not going to proceed with the project.  This put me in a very bad situation since my boss was adamant on the project going forward.  I was able to talk to my boss and explain the department was no longer interested.  Although she was upset, she cceptes the change.  I was very nervous talking to her about the decision to stop the project.\n",
      "The weekly invoicing system had failed and it was up to me to fix it.  The money owed to eight thousand agents and required additional system updating was on hold until I found the answer.

      "At the encouragement of a coworker who had done so, I applied for and was accepted to a position as a consultant for the company in which I had been doing Technical Support of the product. Unfortunately, the only training I got was to shadow other consultants on a few of their trips and observe what they did, but that turned out to be completely inadequate in preparing me for the task. In particular, I did not have the deep knowledge I needed of the Windows operating system and I really floundered on my solo appointments once my training period ended. What I tried to do to deal with the issues was email the other consultants with questions while I was on site, but they had their own work to do and quickly grew tired of trying to hold my hand via email. After only a few months of being unsuccessful at the job, I went back to Technical Support.\n",

      "A few weeks ago while working with our clients, one of them had a crisis. She got very upset and started throwing and breaking things, and went to her room and started ripping up all her papers. She was grabbing for things to injure herself and we were there to try to deescalate her and remove dangerous items. It was really hard for me as it was the first time I was in this situation and I didn't feel helpful and felt useless. I was nervous to do the wrong thing and couldn't think of things to do. It made me feel bad about my performance and I was worried other people thought I did a bad job too. However, after speaking with my coworkers they all said I handled it well and were proud of me. It made me realize that I shouldn't be so hard on myself and I will learn with time and experience how to better handle crises.\n",
      "I'd like you to know something very important about me. I don't like to define myself by my limitations in life, but I also don't want to forgo the identity that comes along with having a particular way of seeing the world. You might call it a \"diagnosis\" but autism is much more to me than that. I haven't told anyone else that I'm autistic, but I think most people would not be surprised. I wasn't diagnosed until I was an adult and I suffered for many years. But to be clear, I didn't suffer because I'm autistic. I suffered because I didn't KNOW that I was autistic. Instead, I believed there was something wrong with me or that I was bad.\n",
      "I think realizing that the child is now the number one priority in your life makes you a good parent. I think that always putting their health and safety first in every decision you make is important. I also think that attending to their social needs is just as important as their physical needs. Teaching them to treat others with kindness.\n",
      "I would share that I've had a very difficult time following my divorce. Specifically in learning how to manage finances and pay bills, something my husband always did, that I never had to learn how to do myself as a result. I would likely ask the person if they had any advice for me.\n",
      "I want to share a bit of my story with you. I have had a hard life and have been done wrong by so many people. I may seem like a hard nut to crack, but I just don't easily trust after all the hurt I've suffered over the years. I keep a limited number of people close to me because the bigger my circle gets, the chances of being hurt increase. I am tired of having people talk about me behind my back or do something to me that betrays my friendship. I want you to know that I understand these things about myself and that I am working to be open and welcome your friendship.\n",

I called a friend who recommended her cousin. He showed up the same day, and we completed the job together. I paid him $20/hour.\n",
      "I just wanted to share my favorite experience with one of my favorite hobbies, that being music. The best that experience that I have had with music is going to a concert for my favorite artist. Attending live concerts is such an amazing experience and I gained so much from seeing live music played, especially with COVID preventing concerts and live music for so long. The rush of getting to hear raw vocals is a feeling that provides so much more emotion than hearing the recorded vocals that we are used to. Getting to be around others who appreciate the same music as you is so fun and a great way of making new acquaintances. You get to make an easy connection through music and it feels very natural.\n",

I'm not religious and I'm mostly annoyed by people who are overtly religious.  Beyond that I'd share my hobbies and interests.\n",
      "It was really hard when I had to go in for additional training at work. It was like a year after I first joined. I guess they weren't happy with what I was doing and made me undergo training, which was basically like probation with close instructions that I already learned when I first joined. It was so depressing to have to go through that, feeling like I'm on thin ice and drowning. But I did get through that and keep working there for about three more years. That isn't a bad track record in my book. That entire job had its ups and downs since they didn't train me that well or really respond the way I hoped when challenges arose.\n",

      "When I worked at the Chrysler Proving Grounds from February 1997 to October 1998, my job was to have vehicles put through an accelerated aging process and to evaluate the vehicle as it has some miles, wear and tear on it. When I had a Dodge van configured as a bus, I found exactly 36 discreet issues. Since 3 to 7 was much more typical, my supervisor did not like the large number, saying that it was too much for the assembly plant to consider and they would end up ignoring it all. He wanted me to cut it down to less than 10. I rated each item as just how bad a customer would find each item, then secondarily, just how hard it would be to correct. That is to change the build process to prevent these items from ever being found on another vehicle. I presented this list to my supervisor and asked him to come out with me in the vehicle so he could experience each for himself. We ended up presenting 21 items to the plant. I was able to convince my supervisor that some were just easy to fix, but others were just going to be so unsettling to a customer that they really called for additional effort. I felt that was a very big win. The assembly plant did work on all of these, immediately implementing any that I found the root cause and offered a solution that was inexpensive and relatively easy to implement. Following that, upper management at Dodge Truck sent a letter of thanks to our manager, and he shared with us. They also had me test additional vans after changes were put into process. It was great to see improvement in the product that was responsible for identifying.\n",
      "Something that makes a good parent to me is what I experienced with my own parent especially my mother. She was a person that always made sure that she worked outside of the house to make sure that there were things available for her children. She made sure that there was a rood over our heads and also made sure that there was food on the table. That hard work and dedication was reflected in her children later in life where they pursued work without have any issue and continue to work despite cahllenges that may have come.\n",
      "I was new to a position when the company's main software system was being changed over to a different system. The type of job I had involved a lot of multi tasking, and there was little training for any of my duties. I had to learn as I did things, and I was having trouble understanding the new system because I did not have a lot of concentrated time to learn it. I made study sheets and also practiced at home, and eventually became proficient on my own.\n",
      "I am highly interested in everything related to space and cosmology, especially stargazing, telescopes, and astrophotography. I love keeping up with the new and exciting discoveries made each day.\n",
      "I had to work with a client recently who was extremely difficult to work with. She had a number of mental health issues, so it wasn't her fault, but trying to work with her was extremely trying. She often yelled and screamed at me. I had to learn how to manage her reactions and keep conversations moving forward so that I could try to help her.\n",
      "I was an English teacher at a high school in Tokyo, and the students were extremely disrespectful because I was a foreigner and my Japanese skills were at a beginner level. At the start, I was taken advantage of and treated differently because of the way I looked. I obviously couldn't change the latter, but I decided to take action on the former. Over the next several months, I improved my Japanese skills and developed a curriculum with other staff members that was more organized and effective. The students came to respect me and my classes.\n",
      "I think a good parent is a good listener.  I think they take the time to look at the child and really take in what the child needs to say.  There are times when you don't need to listen as closely as others but always take the time to evaluate how important this is to the child.  My mother always said a child knows a lot about adults and what is going on.  Adults let their guard down around children and children are very quick to pick up on attitudes, etc.  Also, a good parent follows through with what they tell the child they are going to do.  Don't tell a child you are going to do one thing and not follow through.  Teach them you mean what you say and say what you mean.   Show the child respect.  Set boundaries so the child will know how to set boundaries in their life.   Last but not least, show the child love.\n",
      "The most important thing to be is my family. We like to keep the kids enrolled in various activities, so stay pretty busy with that. Our son is really into karate and does that twice a week. Our daughter is all over the place, though. She's the wild and crazy one that is willing to try everything. We also like to travel. The beach is definitely our top choice for a vacation, and we do that at least once a year. We'll also try and plan a long weekend type trip to the mountains or some place like Branson.\n",
      "One difficult challenge I experienced in the workplace was my manager's overbearing nature. There are 4 people in my work group, and we all felt that our manager was making it more difficult to do our work. We took it upon ourselves to talk to the senior leadership team to help us address this issue.\n",
      "What makes a good parent is a willingness to put someone else's best interest consistently and uniformly first as often as possible while recognizing that none of us are perfect and that we all make mistakes. Having your child's welfare and wellbeing as your north star as a parent is the best way to navigate through the inevitable trials and tribulations that will arise raising a child.\n",
      "I recently found out that our group is being cut in size, and I would eventually be laid off due to the reduction in force.  This was very challenging news to hear, and it took some time to digest.  Rather than stew on the decision, I learned to accept it, understand why the decision was made, and move on from the experience.  I made it a point to reach out to strong connections that I have made on the way, and look at a wide variety of opportunities.  I decided to use the news as a chance to take new risks, rather than feel safe in a situation.\n",
      "We had a big event in town and were expecting an absolute overflow of clientele.  Unfortunately, a lot of our entertainers decided to take the night off.  This put us in a very tenuous position.  I had to reach out to everybody, even old associates, so that we might keep the show alive.  It was stressful and tough at times but, in the end, we managed to fill the roster and were able to take full advantage of the extra business.\n",
      "given to show what it is to be a great father, I think it is one of the most important things while thinking about the future of having a great family.\n",
      "I'm really fortunate in my wife.  I didn't particularly choose her for her musical tendencies, but the fact that we both play brass instruments has really drawn us together.  It's really cool when a couple has an interest in common.\n",
      "What makes someone a good parent is probably not that hard to pin down. My mother wouldn't' t have been considered a particularly good parent over all but she got the job done. She treated me right, taught me what I needed to know and I developed normally. Perhaps nearly all parents (excluding the obvious examples criminals, child abusers, drug addicts, psychopaths etc) are good parents. When children of ordinary people go wrong my suspicion is that it is merely the kind of person the child is. I can see why people blame themselves for their children growing up to become bad people but as an impartial observer I don't see that the parents are to blame. If the parent performed the basic duties and ended up with a little Joseph Stalin then that is something that is probably out of their hands.\n",
      "I am a very open minded person.  I want people to know this.  I focus on age, gender, politics or orientation.  I want everyone to be treated equally.  everyone deserves a fair chance at life and if we can practice acceptance as individuals we can do this in society as a whole.\n",

By being acknowledging issues or problems a child may face and being calm as help them understand what to do, they will apply that to their own behavior.\n",
      "Let your children know that it's ok to open up to you, have a close relationship with them and make them feel comfortable coming to you with their issues.

      "It was hard enough to keep up with my workload and managers often said I was not pulling my wait.  I had expertise in my field and saw errors others did not.

When I was a child I was often at odds with him, mostly because I didn't understand yet the lesson he was teaching.  But I respect him for staying true to his principles and not caving into a child who didn't how he was talking about.  In general, what made him a good parent was setting an example by living an honest life with integrity.\n",

      "Many years ago I worked for a property management company that had and still does have a large portfolio of apartment complexes that they own and operate.  I was an area director.  My role was as the middle person between onsite management/staff and the corporate office.  I had several properties that I was responsible for and was on call 24/7.  One weekend I received a call from the onsite manager of one of the buildings telling me that a mentally challenged man who lived in a group home had somehow gotten into the building, made his way to the tenth floor laundry room and jumped out of the window landing on the sidewalk below.  I had to go to the property and deal with the situation including talking with the authorities and making sure the media stayed off the property and did their reporting from a distance.\n",

But he was always behind and full of excuses.  Being the immediate supervisor I was asked to speak with him, and it just did not go well.  He continued to make excuses, accused us of grouping against him, etc.  It is sad because we pride ourselves on putting employees above profit.  I did not have authority to fire him on the spot but was granted this and did so later.  I guess overcoming it was eliminating the problem, but it really was mutual.\n",

      "Back when I was working customer service there were times where I was the only one working in a large department. I would often have to juggle multiple customers and keep an eye on area that took around 2-4 people to do so effectively. There were times where I would have to deal with multiple customers simultaneously and their issues weren't ones that I could deal with quickly. I ultimately had to acknowledge that I couldn't affectively deal with both groups of customers and so I asked for help from some employees working in a different section to at least try to assist the group that was easier to deal with. After effectively serving the more difficult group of customers I then immediately headed over to the other group to take over and thank my coworker for assisting. In this particular instance however the coworker did a good job of helping the customers and I simply helped affirm to the customer that my coworkers advice and recommendations were what they should try.\n",

It was a very trying time also very rewarding.\n",

      "A difficult challenge I had to overcome was when a fellow employee made a critical error that caused a serious business disruption for our clients, they were not able to deposit or withdraw money from their account for a period of 48 hours.

      "Since I am the handyman and repairman in the facility, it is my job to fix things quickly to keep things running, especially during the busy times of the year. As often happens, one weekend a machine broke down and since the businesses were closed to get new parts, I needed to come up with a solution to keep things moving. By examing the broken part, I felt I could weld it back together and keep the machine working until a new part could replace the broken one. I was able to fix it and the machine woked perfectly until we had time later to replace the new part\n",

      "A difficult challenge that I experienced was a startup of 26 bank branches, immediately after the previous bank closes and ends their lease.  Our corporate executives had an opportunity to sign leases on 26 high visibility properties in a major metropolitan area and the signing was done 30 days before the other bank's lease was up and they were closing.  We had no advanced notice, besides the 30 days.  In the past we have never opened a new branch with only 30 days of planning.  The CEO wanted us in the buildings at 12:01 AM the night that our lease started, which was a Saturday morning, and we had to have the branches open at 9 AM on Monday morning.  The amount of planning and preparation, and the number of teams involved was extraordinary.  We had to have multiple contractors and vendors engaged, locks changed, signage installed, safe locks changed, ATM's changed, computer and phone systems installed and more.  We used a punchlist which has been used previously, but this required extreme coordination to do it in just over 48 hours and a huge amount of people working together seamlessly to make it all happen.\n",
      "One of the most difficult experiences I had in the workplace was when I was selected for an early work at home program. This was back in 2003 when working remotely was new. The difficulty is that when I started working from home, people would scrutinize my work more closely and being absent from the work environment isolated me and took me out of contention from opportunities that would be there if I had been in the office.  I overcame this by negotiating being in the office some of the week and working at home for the rest.  It helped me to remain present while being able to test the remote working atmosphere.\n",
      "The last really difficult challenge I expierenced in the workplace was training one of the newest employees for front desk. I work at a busy three doctor animal hospital, and the girl they chose to hire had no prior vet experience, or knowledge of the subject. She was in rough shape, but was willing to learn. I still had a really tough time the first two or three months, having to basically man the front desk by myself, as well as train this new girl on how to run everything. It was tough, but I made it through, and now, almost 6 months later, I finally am working with someone I trust for the most part. She still is rough around the edges, but knows what an emergency is and what isn't and is good about scheduling. We also get along quite well nonw.\n",

      "Mrs. Grimison was the best parent in my neighborhood, where I grew up.  She was great, because she was a stay home mother of 6, an constantly kept an eye on all of them.  She was a hippie at heart, but also a devote catholic, which she inspired in her children, without being forceful in doing so.  Her husband was mostly, at work, all the time, but she was always there for her children, and gave plenty of love to them, without spoiling any of the with gifts, as most parents do, as a bribe.  The \"proof is in the pudding\"; even though none of her children have been super successful, they are all happy, and none have them have been, \"in trouble\".\n",

      "I once was given a very large workload to complete in a very short amount of time. It was considerably larger than the standard workload, so I wasn't sure if I would be able to complete it all in time. I knew that if I didn't try, I would get nowhere, so I immediately started working as hard as I could. I knew that if I didn't give it one hundred percent of my effort, I wouldn't finish, so I tried my hardest to complete all of it. I didn't take any unnecessary breaks and as a result was able to just barely complete it in time.\n",

      "Some of my coworkers could be difficult and not want to corporate. They did not contribute to group work or other responsibilities that was apart of everyone's job. This was difficult because it hurt the entire team and made all of our work more of a challenge. There was not an easy solution to this problem. As time went on most of my coworkers and I started getting better at being a team. This got everyone to feel more unified and that created a better environment for us to collaborate. Ultimately we got most team members to contribute and everyone had relatively equal responsibilities.\n",
      "Someone that makes a good parent is someone that is patient.

He made sure his children always knew he loves. The important aspect of parenting to me is consistency. He treated all three the same. He was patient, understanding and not afraid to reach out to others for parenting advice. You can read all the books you want on parenting, but nothing teaches anyone better than experience itself. It shows that good parenting isn’t what we know or read, it’s who we are, the unconditional love of a miracle.\n",
